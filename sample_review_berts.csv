0,None (Original Review),"So wonderful, so quirky, so romantic, so Italian. The film is so feather -light you float off into its refracted reality and you never want to return to the humdrum again. A kitchen sink world of bakeries, and hairdressers, and plumbing, but one that shimmers with a soft luminescence. Should the credit go to the screenplay or the direction? Take your pick -- they're both faultless.

0,"So wonderful, so quirky, so romantic, so Italian."," The film is so feather -light you float off into its refracted reality and you never want to return to the humdrum again..  A kitchen sink world of bakeries, and hairdressers, and plumbing, but one that shimmers with a soft luminescence..  Should the credit go to the screenplay or the direction?

0, The film is so feather -light you float off into its refracted reality and you never want to return to the humdrum again.,"So wonderful, so quirky, so romantic, so Italian..  A kitchen sink world of bakeries, and hairdressers, and plumbing, but one that shimmers with a soft luminescence..  Should the credit go to the screenplay or the direction?

0," A kitchen sink world of bakeries, and hairdressers, and plumbing, but one that shimmers with a soft luminescence.","So wonderful, so quirky, so romantic, so Italian..

0, Should the credit go to the screenplay or the direction? Take your pick -- they're both faultless.,"So wonderful, so quirky, so romantic, so Italian..  The film is so feather -light you float off into its refracted reality and you never want to return to the humdrum again..

0, Let me get back to that New York City that lies just beyond the looking glass.,"So wonderful, so quirky, so romantic, so Italian..  The film is so feather -light you float off into its refracted reality and you never want to return to the humdrum again..  A kitchen sink world of bakeries, and hairdressers, and plumbing, but one that shimmers with a soft luminescence..  Should the credit go to the screenplay or the direction?

1,None (Original Review),"Director: Tay Garnett, Ford Beebe, Cast: Mike Mazurki, Vic Christy, Fritz Ford, Tay Garnett.<br /><br />Based on the number of comments I see on IMDb, this seems to be a forgotten movie. This seems rather ironic to me because it is actually one of the first movies that I remember. My mom took me and my little brother to see this film at The Garland theater in Spokane when it first came out in the mid 1970's and I still remember it.<br /><br />I am going by memory here but I believe this move is about a trapper who was accused of a crime which he did not commit and the law goes after him. I believe it to be set in 1800's Alaska. A narrator tells the story of the trapper played by Mike Mazurki. Really, this is a very good film with a great setting.

1,"Director: Tay Garnett, Ford Beebe, Cast: Mike Mazurki, Vic Christy, Fritz Ford, Tay Garnett.","<br /><br />Based on the number of comments I see on IMDb, this seems to be a forgotten movie..  This seems rather ironic to me because it is actually one of the first movies that I remember..  My mom took me and my little brother to see this film at The Garland theater in Spokane when it first came out in the mid 1970's and I still remember it.. <br /><br />I am going by memory here but I believe this move is about a trapper who was accused of a crime which he did not commit and the law goes after him..  I believe it to be set in 1800's Alaska..  A narrator tells the story of the trapper played by Mike Mazurki..  Really, this is a very good film with a great setting..  It could be compared to the 1981 film Death Hunt with Charles Bronson..  The two films have a very similar story line..  The main difference between the two is Death Hunt is an adult orientated film whereas Challenge is a family friendly film..  <br /><br />Mike Mazurki and Tay Garnett were both rather old when this movie was made which I find rather impressive when one considers that this movie was filmed on location in the wilds of Alaska..  This was the last film made by Tay Garnett before he died which was just a few years later..  They both had been around since the silent era..

1,"<br /><br />Based on the number of comments I see on IMDb, this seems to be a forgotten movie.","Director: Tay Garnett, Ford Beebe, Cast: Mike Mazurki, Vic Christy, Fritz Ford, Tay Garnett..  This seems rather ironic to me because it is actually one of the first movies that I remember..  My mom took me and my little brother to see this film at The Garland theater in Spokane when it first came out in the mid 1970's and I still remember it.. <br /><br />I am going by memory here but I believe this move is about a trapper who was accused of a crime which he did not commit and the law goes after him..  I believe it to be set in 1800's Alaska..  A narrator tells the story of the trapper played by Mike Mazurki..  Really, this is a very good film with a great setting..  It could be compared to the 1981 film Death Hunt with Charles Bronson..  The two films have a very similar story line..  The main difference between the two is Death Hunt is an adult orientated film whereas Challenge is a family friendly film..  <br /><br />Mike Mazurki and Tay Garnett were both rather old when this movie was made which I find rather impressive when one considers that this movie was filmed on location in the wilds of Alaska..  This was the last film made by Tay Garnett before he died which was just a few years later..  They both had been around since the silent era..

1, This seems rather ironic to me because it is actually one of the first movies that I remember.,"Director: Tay Garnett, Ford Beebe, Cast: Mike Mazurki, Vic Christy, Fritz Ford, Tay Garnett.. <br /><br />Based on the number of comments I see on IMDb, this seems to be a forgotten movie..  My mom took me and my little brother to see this film at The Garland theater in Spokane when it first came out in the mid 1970's and I still remember it.. <br /><br />I am going by memory here but I believe this move is about a trapper who was accused of a crime which he did not commit and the law goes after him..  I believe it to be set in 1800's Alaska..  A narrator tells the story of the trapper played by Mike Mazurki..  Really, this is a very good film with a great setting..  It could be compared to the 1981 film Death Hunt with Charles Bronson..  The two films have a very similar story line..  The main difference between the two is Death Hunt is an adult orientated film whereas Challenge is a family friendly film..  <br /><br />Mike Mazurki and Tay Garnett were both rather old when this movie was made which I find rather impressive when one considers that this movie was filmed on location in the wilds of Alaska..  This was the last film made by Tay Garnett before he died which was just a few years later..  They both had been around since the silent era..

1, My mom took me and my little brother to see this film at The Garland theater in Spokane when it first came out in the mid 1970's and I still remember it.,"Director: Tay Garnett, Ford Beebe, Cast: Mike Mazurki, Vic Christy, Fritz Ford, Tay Garnett.. <br /><br />Based on the number of comments I see on IMDb, this seems to be a forgotten movie..  This seems rather ironic to me because it is actually one of the first movies that I remember.. <br /><br />I am going by memory here but I believe this move is about a trapper who was accused of a crime which he did not commit and the law goes after him..  I believe it to be set in 1800's Alaska..  A narrator tells the story of the trapper played by Mike Mazurki..  Really, this is a very good film with a great setting..  It could be compared to the 1981 film Death Hunt with Charles Bronson..  The two films have a very similar story line..  The main difference between the two is Death Hunt is an adult orientated film whereas Challenge is a family friendly film..  <br /><br />Mike Mazurki and Tay Garnett were both rather old when this movie was made which I find rather impressive when one considers that this movie was filmed on location in the wilds of Alaska..  This was the last film made by Tay Garnett before he died which was just a few years later..  They both had been around since the silent era..

1,<br /><br />I am going by memory here but I believe this move is about a trapper who was accused of a crime which he did not commit and the law goes after him.,"Director: Tay Garnett, Ford Beebe, Cast: Mike Mazurki, Vic Christy, Fritz Ford, Tay Garnett.. <br /><br />Based on the number of comments I see on IMDb, this seems to be a forgotten movie..  This seems rather ironic to me because it is actually one of the first movies that I remember..  My mom took me and my little brother to see this film at The Garland theater in Spokane when it first came out in the mid 1970's and I still remember it..  I believe it to be set in 1800's Alaska..  A narrator tells the story of the trapper played by Mike Mazurki..  Really, this is a very good film with a great setting..  It could be compared to the 1981 film Death Hunt with Charles Bronson..  The two films have a very similar story line..  The main difference between the two is Death Hunt is an adult orientated film whereas Challenge is a family friendly film..  <br /><br />Mike Mazurki and Tay Garnett were both rather old when this movie was made which I find rather impressive when one considers that this movie was filmed on location in the wilds of Alaska..  This was the last film made by Tay Garnett before he died which was just a few years later..  They both had been around since the silent era..

1, I believe it to be set in 1800's Alaska.,"Director: Tay Garnett, Ford Beebe, Cast: Mike Mazurki, Vic Christy, Fritz Ford, Tay Garnett.. <br /><br />Based on the number of comments I see on IMDb, this seems to be a forgotten movie..  This seems rather ironic to me because it is actually one of the first movies that I remember..  My mom took me and my little brother to see this film at The Garland theater in Spokane when it first came out in the mid 1970's and I still remember it.. <br /><br />I am going by memory here but I believe this move is about a trapper who was accused of a crime which he did not commit and the law goes after him..  A narrator tells the story of the trapper played by Mike Mazurki..  Really, this is a very good film with a great setting..  It could be compared to the 1981 film Death Hunt with Charles Bronson..  The two films have a very similar story line..  The main difference between the two is Death Hunt is an adult orientated film whereas Challenge is a family friendly film..  <br /><br />Mike Mazurki and Tay Garnett were both rather old when this movie was made which I find rather impressive when one considers that this movie was filmed on location in the wilds of Alaska..  This was the last film made by Tay Garnett before he died which was just a few years later..  They both had been around since the silent era..

1, A narrator tells the story of the trapper played by Mike Mazurki.,"Director: Tay Garnett, Ford Beebe, Cast: Mike Mazurki, Vic Christy, Fritz Ford, Tay Garnett.. <br /><br />Based on the number of comments I see on IMDb, this seems to be a forgotten movie..  This seems rather ironic to me because it is actually one of the first movies that I remember..  My mom took me and my little brother to see this film at The Garland theater in Spokane when it first came out in the mid 1970's and I still remember it.. <br /><br />I am going by memory here but I believe this move is about a trapper who was accused of a crime which he did not commit and the law goes after him..  I believe it to be set in 1800's Alaska..  Really, this is a very good film with a great setting..  It could be compared to the 1981 film Death Hunt with Charles Bronson..  The two films have a very similar story line..  The main difference between the two is Death Hunt is an adult orientated film whereas Challenge is a family friendly film..  <br /><br />Mike Mazurki and Tay Garnett were both rather old when this movie was made which I find rather impressive when one considers that this movie was filmed on location in the wilds of Alaska..  This was the last film made by Tay Garnett before he died which was just a few years later..  They both had been around since the silent era..

1," Really, this is a very good film with a great setting.","Director: Tay Garnett, Ford Beebe, Cast: Mike Mazurki, Vic Christy, Fritz Ford, Tay Garnett.. <br /><br />Based on the number of comments I see on IMDb, this seems to be a forgotten movie..  This seems rather ironic to me because it is actually one of the first movies that I remember..  My mom took me and my little brother to see this film at The Garland theater in Spokane when it first came out in the mid 1970's and I still remember it.. <br /><br />I am going by memory here but I believe this move is about a trapper who was accused of a crime which he did not commit and the law goes after him..  I believe it to be set in 1800's Alaska..  A narrator tells the story of the trapper played by Mike Mazurki..  It could be compared to the 1981 film Death Hunt with Charles Bronson..  The two films have a very similar story line..  The main difference between the two is Death Hunt is an adult orientated film whereas Challenge is a family friendly film..  <br /><br />Mike Mazurki and Tay Garnett were both rather old when this movie was made which I find rather impressive when one considers that this movie was filmed on location in the wilds of Alaska..  This was the last film made by Tay Garnett before he died which was just a few years later..  They both had been around since the silent era..

1, It could be compared to the 1981 film Death Hunt with Charles Bronson.,"Director: Tay Garnett, Ford Beebe, Cast: Mike Mazurki, Vic Christy, Fritz Ford, Tay Garnett.. <br /><br />Based on the number of comments I see on IMDb, this seems to be a forgotten movie..  This seems rather ironic to me because it is actually one of the first movies that I remember..  My mom took me and my little brother to see this film at The Garland theater in Spokane when it first came out in the mid 1970's and I still remember it.. <br /><br />I am going by memory here but I believe this move is about a trapper who was accused of a crime which he did not commit and the law goes after him..  I believe it to be set in 1800's Alaska..  A narrator tells the story of the trapper played by Mike Mazurki..  Really, this is a very good film with a great setting..  The two films have a very similar story line..  The main difference between the two is Death Hunt is an adult orientated film whereas Challenge is a family friendly film..  <br /><br />Mike Mazurki and Tay Garnett were both rather old when this movie was made which I find rather impressive when one considers that this movie was filmed on location in the wilds of Alaska..  This was the last film made by Tay Garnett before he died which was just a few years later..  They both had been around since the silent era..

1, The two films have a very similar story line.,"Director: Tay Garnett, Ford Beebe, Cast: Mike Mazurki, Vic Christy, Fritz Ford, Tay Garnett.. <br /><br />Based on the number of comments I see on IMDb, this seems to be a forgotten movie..  This seems rather ironic to me because it is actually one of the first movies that I remember..  My mom took me and my little brother to see this film at The Garland theater in Spokane when it first came out in the mid 1970's and I still remember it.. <br /><br />I am going by memory here but I believe this move is about a trapper who was accused of a crime which he did not commit and the law goes after him..  I believe it to be set in 1800's Alaska..  A narrator tells the story of the trapper played by Mike Mazurki..  Really, this is a very good film with a great setting..  It could be compared to the 1981 film Death Hunt with Charles Bronson..  The main difference between the two is Death Hunt is an adult orientated film whereas Challenge is a family friendly film..  <br /><br />Mike Mazurki and Tay Garnett were both rather old when this movie was made which I find rather impressive when one considers that this movie was filmed on location in the wilds of Alaska..  This was the last film made by Tay Garnett before he died which was just a few years later..  They both had been around since the silent era..

1, The main difference between the two is Death Hunt is an adult orientated film whereas Challenge is a family friendly film.,"Director: Tay Garnett, Ford Beebe, Cast: Mike Mazurki, Vic Christy, Fritz Ford, Tay Garnett.. <br /><br />Based on the number of comments I see on IMDb, this seems to be a forgotten movie..  This seems rather ironic to me because it is actually one of the first movies that I remember..  My mom took me and my little brother to see this film at The Garland theater in Spokane when it first came out in the mid 1970's and I still remember it.. <br /><br />I am going by memory here but I believe this move is about a trapper who was accused of a crime which he did not commit and the law goes after him..  I believe it to be set in 1800's Alaska..  A narrator tells the story of the trapper played by Mike Mazurki..  Really, this is a very good film with a great setting..  It could be compared to the 1981 film Death Hunt with Charles Bronson..  The two films have a very similar story line..  <br /><br />Mike Mazurki and Tay Garnett were both rather old when this movie was made which I find rather impressive when one considers that this movie was filmed on location in the wilds of Alaska..  This was the last film made by Tay Garnett before he died which was just a few years later..  They both had been around since the silent era..

1, <br /><br />Mike Mazurki and Tay Garnett were both rather old when this movie was made which I find rather impressive when one considers that this movie was filmed on location in the wilds of Alaska.,"Director: Tay Garnett, Ford Beebe, Cast: Mike Mazurki, Vic Christy, Fritz Ford, Tay Garnett.. <br /><br />Based on the number of comments I see on IMDb, this seems to be a forgotten movie..  This seems rather ironic to me because it is actually one of the first movies that I remember..  My mom took me and my little brother to see this film at The Garland theater in Spokane when it first came out in the mid 1970's and I still remember it.. <br /><br />I am going by memory here but I believe this move is about a trapper who was accused of a crime which he did not commit and the law goes after him..  I believe it to be set in 1800's Alaska..  A narrator tells the story of the trapper played by Mike Mazurki..  Really, this is a very good film with a great setting..  It could be compared to the 1981 film Death Hunt with Charles Bronson..  The two films have a very similar story line..  The main difference between the two is Death Hunt is an adult orientated film whereas Challenge is a family friendly film..

1, This was the last film made by Tay Garnett before he died which was just a few years later.,"Director: Tay Garnett, Ford Beebe, Cast: Mike Mazurki, Vic Christy, Fritz Ford, Tay Garnett.. <br /><br />Based on the number of comments I see on IMDb, this seems to be a forgotten movie..  This seems rather ironic to me because it is actually one of the first movies that I remember..  My mom took me and my little brother to see this film at The Garland theater in Spokane when it first came out in the mid 1970's and I still remember it.. <br /><br />I am going by memory here but I believe this move is about a trapper who was accused of a crime which he did not commit and the law goes after him..  I believe it to be set in 1800's Alaska..  A narrator tells the story of the trapper played by Mike Mazurki..  Really, this is a very good film with a great setting..  It could be compared to the 1981 film Death Hunt with Charles Bronson..  The two films have a very similar story line..  The main difference between the two is Death Hunt is an adult orientated film whereas Challenge is a family friendly film..  <br /><br />Mike Mazurki and Tay Garnett were both rather old when this movie was made which I find rather impressive when one considers that this movie was filmed on location in the wilds of Alaska..  They both had been around since the silent era..

1, They both had been around since the silent era.,"Director: Tay Garnett, Ford Beebe, Cast: Mike Mazurki, Vic Christy, Fritz Ford, Tay Garnett.. <br /><br />Based on the number of comments I see on IMDb, this seems to be a forgotten movie..  This seems rather ironic to me because it is actually one of the first movies that I remember..  My mom took me and my little brother to see this film at The Garland theater in Spokane when it first came out in the mid 1970's and I still remember it.. <br /><br />I am going by memory here but I believe this move is about a trapper who was accused of a crime which he did not commit and the law goes after him..  I believe it to be set in 1800's Alaska..  A narrator tells the story of the trapper played by Mike Mazurki..  Really, this is a very good film with a great setting..  It could be compared to the 1981 film Death Hunt with Charles Bronson..  The two films have a very similar story line..  The main difference between the two is Death Hunt is an adult orientated film whereas Challenge is a family friendly film..  <br /><br />Mike Mazurki and Tay Garnett were both rather old when this movie was made which I find rather impressive when one considers that this movie was filmed on location in the wilds of Alaska..  This was the last film made by Tay Garnett before he died which was just a few years later..

2,None (Original Review),"\Two Hands\"""" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.<br /><br />It is that curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love the Australians have developed on their own.<br /><br />Heath Ledger is basically a good if naive guy. Wanting to get on he falls in with a local \""""Big\"""" Man Pando (Bryan Brown). But at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets Alex (Rose Byrne). Here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected. After getting on the wrong side of Pando accidentally, things get very bad very quickly and if not for a little otherworldly help this would have been a short sad film. Yes, Jimmy learns a few lessons in life and no one escapes uninjured in one way or another but at the end of it has a feel good feel to it. Although there is a lawless theme through the story, it is not glorified and helps to show how destructive crime can be on normal lives.<br /><br />Heath Ledger is excellent as Jimmy, innocent and savvy at the same time, Rose is hypnotic as Alex and Bryan is marvellous as usual. This is a small ensemble of characters are believable and I found myself caring about the good guys and disliking the baddies.<br /><br />This DVD is usually in the cheap aisle so I would recommend

2,"\Two Hands\"""" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.","<br /><br />It is that curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love the Australians have developed on their own.. <br /><br />Heath Ledger is basically a good if naive guy..  Wanting to get on he falls in with a local \""""Big\"""" Man Pando (Bryan Brown)..  But at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets Alex (Rose Byrne)..  Here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected..  After getting on the wrong side of Pando accidentally, things get very bad very quickly and if not for a little otherworldly help this would have been a short sad film..  Yes, Jimmy learns a few lessons in life and no one escapes uninjured in one way or another but at the end of it has a feel good feel to it..  Although there is a lawless theme through the story, it is not glorified and helps to show how destructive crime can be on normal lives.. <br /><br />Heath Ledger is excellent as Jimmy, innocent and savvy at the same time, Rose is hypnotic as Alex and Bryan is marvellous as usual..  This is a small ensemble of characters are believable and I found myself caring about the good guys and disliking the baddies.. <br /><br />This DVD is usually in the cheap aisle so I would recommend

2,"<br /><br />It is that curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love the Australians have developed on their own.","\Two Hands\"""" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.. <br /><br />Heath Ledger is basically a good if naive guy..  Wanting to get on he falls in with a local \""""Big\"""" Man Pando (Bryan Brown)..  But at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets Alex (Rose Byrne)..  Here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected..  After getting on the wrong side of Pando accidentally, things get very bad very quickly and if not for a little otherworldly help this would have been a short sad film..  Yes, Jimmy learns a few lessons in life and no one escapes uninjured in one way or another but at the end of it has a feel good feel to it..  Although there is a lawless theme through the story, it is not glorified and helps to show how destructive crime can be on normal lives.. <br /><br />Heath Ledger is excellent as Jimmy, innocent and savvy at the same time, Rose is hypnotic as Alex and Bryan is marvellous as usual..  This is a small ensemble of characters are believable and I found myself caring about the good guys and disliking the baddies.. <br /><br />This DVD is usually in the cheap aisle so I would recommend

2,<br /><br />Heath Ledger is basically a good if naive guy.,"\Two Hands\"""" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.. <br /><br />It is that curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love the Australians have developed on their own..  Wanting to get on he falls in with a local \""""Big\"""" Man Pando (Bryan Brown)..  But at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets Alex (Rose Byrne)..  Here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected..  After getting on the wrong side of Pando accidentally, things get very bad very quickly and if not for a little otherworldly help this would have been a short sad film..  Yes, Jimmy learns a few lessons in life and no one escapes uninjured in one way or another but at the end of it has a feel good feel to it..  Although there is a lawless theme through the story, it is not glorified and helps to show how destructive crime can be on normal lives.. <br /><br />Heath Ledger is excellent as Jimmy, innocent and savvy at the same time, Rose is hypnotic as Alex and Bryan is marvellous as usual..  This is a small ensemble of characters are believable and I found myself caring about the good guys and disliking the baddies.. <br /><br />This DVD is usually in the cheap aisle so I would recommend

2," Wanting to get on he falls in with a local \""""Big\"""" Man Pando (Bryan Brown).","\Two Hands\"""" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.. <br /><br />It is that curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love the Australians have developed on their own.. <br /><br />Heath Ledger is basically a good if naive guy..  But at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets Alex (Rose Byrne)..  Here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected..  After getting on the wrong side of Pando accidentally, things get very bad very quickly and if not for a little otherworldly help this would have been a short sad film..  Yes, Jimmy learns a few lessons in life and no one escapes uninjured in one way or another but at the end of it has a feel good feel to it..  Although there is a lawless theme through the story, it is not glorified and helps to show how destructive crime can be on normal lives.. <br /><br />Heath Ledger is excellent as Jimmy, innocent and savvy at the same time, Rose is hypnotic as Alex and Bryan is marvellous as usual..  This is a small ensemble of characters are believable and I found myself caring about the good guys and disliking the baddies.. <br /><br />This DVD is usually in the cheap aisle so I would recommend

2, But at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets Alex (Rose Byrne).,"\Two Hands\"""" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.. <br /><br />It is that curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love the Australians have developed on their own.. <br /><br />Heath Ledger is basically a good if naive guy..  Wanting to get on he falls in with a local \""""Big\"""" Man Pando (Bryan Brown)..  Here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected..  After getting on the wrong side of Pando accidentally, things get very bad very quickly and if not for a little otherworldly help this would have been a short sad film..  Yes, Jimmy learns a few lessons in life and no one escapes uninjured in one way or another but at the end of it has a feel good feel to it..  Although there is a lawless theme through the story, it is not glorified and helps to show how destructive crime can be on normal lives.. <br /><br />Heath Ledger is excellent as Jimmy, innocent and savvy at the same time, Rose is hypnotic as Alex and Bryan is marvellous as usual..  This is a small ensemble of characters are believable and I found myself caring about the good guys and disliking the baddies.. <br /><br />This DVD is usually in the cheap aisle so I would recommend

2, Here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected.,"\Two Hands\"""" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.. <br /><br />It is that curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love the Australians have developed on their own.. <br /><br />Heath Ledger is basically a good if naive guy..  Wanting to get on he falls in with a local \""""Big\"""" Man Pando (Bryan Brown)..  But at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets Alex (Rose Byrne)..  After getting on the wrong side of Pando accidentally, things get very bad very quickly and if not for a little otherworldly help this would have been a short sad film..  Yes, Jimmy learns a few lessons in life and no one escapes uninjured in one way or another but at the end of it has a feel good feel to it..  Although there is a lawless theme through the story, it is not glorified and helps to show how destructive crime can be on normal lives.. <br /><br />Heath Ledger is excellent as Jimmy, innocent and savvy at the same time, Rose is hypnotic as Alex and Bryan is marvellous as usual..  This is a small ensemble of characters are believable and I found myself caring about the good guys and disliking the baddies.. <br /><br />This DVD is usually in the cheap aisle so I would recommend

2," After getting on the wrong side of Pando accidentally, things get very bad very quickly and if not for a little otherworldly help this would have been a short sad film.","\Two Hands\"""" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.. <br /><br />It is that curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love the Australians have developed on their own.. <br /><br />Heath Ledger is basically a good if naive guy..  Wanting to get on he falls in with a local \""""Big\"""" Man Pando (Bryan Brown)..  But at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets Alex (Rose Byrne)..  Here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected..  Yes, Jimmy learns a few lessons in life and no one escapes uninjured in one way or another but at the end of it has a feel good feel to it..  Although there is a lawless theme through the story, it is not glorified and helps to show how destructive crime can be on normal lives.. <br /><br />Heath Ledger is excellent as Jimmy, innocent and savvy at the same time, Rose is hypnotic as Alex and Bryan is marvellous as usual..  This is a small ensemble of characters are believable and I found myself caring about the good guys and disliking the baddies.. <br /><br />This DVD is usually in the cheap aisle so I would recommend

2," Yes, Jimmy learns a few lessons in life and no one escapes uninjured in one way or another but at the end of it has a feel good feel to it.","\Two Hands\"""" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.. <br /><br />It is that curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love the Australians have developed on their own.. <br /><br />Heath Ledger is basically a good if naive guy..  Wanting to get on he falls in with a local \""""Big\"""" Man Pando (Bryan Brown)..  But at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets Alex (Rose Byrne)..  Here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected..  After getting on the wrong side of Pando accidentally, things get very bad very quickly and if not for a little otherworldly help this would have been a short sad film..  Although there is a lawless theme through the story, it is not glorified and helps to show how destructive crime can be on normal lives.. <br /><br />Heath Ledger is excellent as Jimmy, innocent and savvy at the same time, Rose is hypnotic as Alex and Bryan is marvellous as usual..  This is a small ensemble of characters are believable and I found myself caring about the good guys and disliking the baddies.. <br /><br />This DVD is usually in the cheap aisle so I would recommend

2," Although there is a lawless theme through the story, it is not glorified and helps to show how destructive crime can be on normal lives.","\Two Hands\"""" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.. <br /><br />It is that curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love the Australians have developed on their own.. <br /><br />Heath Ledger is basically a good if naive guy..  Wanting to get on he falls in with a local \""""Big\"""" Man Pando (Bryan Brown)..  But at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets Alex (Rose Byrne)..  Here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected..  After getting on the wrong side of Pando accidentally, things get very bad very quickly and if not for a little otherworldly help this would have been a short sad film..  Yes, Jimmy learns a few lessons in life and no one escapes uninjured in one way or another but at the end of it has a feel good feel to it.. <br /><br />Heath Ledger is excellent as Jimmy, innocent and savvy at the same time, Rose is hypnotic as Alex and Bryan is marvellous as usual..  This is a small ensemble of characters are believable and I found myself caring about the good guys and disliking the baddies.. <br /><br />This DVD is usually in the cheap aisle so I would recommend

2,"<br /><br />Heath Ledger is excellent as Jimmy, innocent and savvy at the same time, Rose is hypnotic as Alex and Bryan is marvellous as usual.","\Two Hands\"""" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.. <br /><br />It is that curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love the Australians have developed on their own.. <br /><br />Heath Ledger is basically a good if naive guy..  Wanting to get on he falls in with a local \""""Big\"""" Man Pando (Bryan Brown)..  But at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets Alex (Rose Byrne)..  Here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected..  After getting on the wrong side of Pando accidentally, things get very bad very quickly and if not for a little otherworldly help this would have been a short sad film..  Yes, Jimmy learns a few lessons in life and no one escapes uninjured in one way or another but at the end of it has a feel good feel to it..  Although there is a lawless theme through the story, it is not glorified and helps to show how destructive crime can be on normal lives..  This is a small ensemble of characters are believable and I found myself caring about the good guys and disliking the baddies.. <br /><br />This DVD is usually in the cheap aisle so I would recommend

2, This is a small ensemble of characters are believable and I found myself caring about the good guys and disliking the baddies.,"\Two Hands\"""" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.. <br /><br />It is that curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love the Australians have developed on their own.. <br /><br />Heath Ledger is basically a good if naive guy..  Wanting to get on he falls in with a local \""""Big\"""" Man Pando (Bryan Brown)..  But at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets Alex (Rose Byrne)..  Here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected..  After getting on the wrong side of Pando accidentally, things get very bad very quickly and if not for a little otherworldly help this would have been a short sad film..  Yes, Jimmy learns a few lessons in life and no one escapes uninjured in one way or another but at the end of it has a feel good feel to it..  Although there is a lawless theme through the story, it is not glorified and helps to show how destructive crime can be on normal lives.. <br /><br />Heath Ledger is excellent as Jimmy, innocent and savvy at the same time, Rose is hypnotic as Alex and Bryan is marvellous as usual.. <br /><br />This DVD is usually in the cheap aisle so I would recommend adding it too your DVD collection, it would

2,"<br /><br />This DVD is usually in the cheap aisle so I would recommend adding it too your DVD collection, it would be money well spent.","\Two Hands\"""" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.. <br /><br />It is that curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love the Australians have developed on their own.. <br /><br />Heath Ledger is basically a good if naive guy..  Wanting to get on he falls in with a local \""""Big\"""" Man Pando (Bryan Brown)..  But at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets Alex (Rose Byrne)..  Here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected..  After getting on the wrong side of Pando accidentally, things get very bad very quickly and if not for a little otherworldly help this would have been a short sad film..  Yes, Jimmy learns a few lessons in life and no one escapes uninjured in one way or another but at the end of it has a feel good feel to it..  Although there is a lawless theme through the story, it is not glorified and helps to show how destructive crime can be on normal lives.. <br /><br />Heath Ledger is excellent as Jimmy, innocent and savvy at the same time, Rose is hypnotic as Alex and Bryan is marvellous as usual..

2,"<br /><br />8 out of 10""""","\Two Hands\"""" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.. <br /><br />It is that curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love the Australians have developed on their own.. <br /><br />Heath Ledger is basically a good if naive guy..  Wanting to get on he falls in with a local \""""Big\"""" Man Pando (Bryan Brown)..  But at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets Alex (Rose Byrne)..  Here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected..  After getting on the wrong side of Pando accidentally, things get very bad very quickly and if not for a little otherworldly help this would have been a short sad film..  Yes, Jimmy learns a few lessons in life and no one escapes uninjured in one way or another but at the end of it has a feel good feel to it..  Although there is a lawless theme through the story, it is not glorified and helps to show how destructive crime can be on normal lives.. <br /><br />Heath Ledger is excellent as Jimmy, innocent and savvy at the same time, Rose is hypnotic as Alex and Bryan is marvellous as usual..  This is a small ensemble of characters are believable and I found myself caring about the good guys and disliking the baddies.. <br /><br />This DVD is usually in the cheap aisle so I would recommend

3,None (Original Review),myself and 2 sisters watched all 3 series of Tenko and agree this is by far one of the BBC better series.The whole cast were very convincing in the parts they portrayed and although the 3rd series was somewhat slower it was compelling viewing and my evenings wont be the same without it.No doubt we will be watching it again as it is a series which I would never get sick of watching.Excellent viewing and full marks to the BBC for such a brilliant series and the casting.First rate in all departments and would recommend this series to anyone although some age limits

3,myself and 2 sisters watched all 3 series of Tenko and agree this is by far one of the BBC better series.,The whole cast were very convincing in the parts they portrayed and although the 3rd series was somewhat slower it was compelling viewing and my evenings wont be the same without it.. No doubt we will be watching it again as it is a series which I would never get sick of watching.. Excellent viewing and full marks to the BBC for such a brilliant series and the casting..

3,The whole cast were very convincing in the parts they portrayed and although the 3rd series was somewhat slower it was compelling viewing and my evenings wont be the same without it.,myself and 2 sisters watched all 3 series of Tenko and agree this is by far one of the BBC better series.. No doubt we will be watching it again as it is a series which I would never get sick of watching.. Excellent viewing and full marks to the BBC for such a brilliant series and the casting..

3,No doubt we will be watching it again as it is a series which I would never get sick of watching.,myself and 2 sisters watched all 3 series of Tenko and agree this is by far one of the BBC better series.. The whole cast were very convincing in the parts they portrayed and although the 3rd series was somewhat slower it was compelling viewing and my evenings wont be the same without it.. Excellent viewing and full marks to the BBC for such a brilliant series and the casting..

3,Excellent viewing and full marks to the BBC for such a brilliant series and the casting.,myself and 2 sisters watched all 3 series of Tenko and agree this is by far one of the BBC better series.. The whole cast were very convincing in the parts they portrayed and although the 3rd series was somewhat slower it was compelling viewing and my evenings wont be the same without it.. No doubt we will be watching it again as it is a series which I would never get sick of watching..

3,First rate in all departments and would recommend this series to anyone although some age limits must be considered because of some adult material.,myself and 2 sisters watched all 3 series of Tenko and agree this is by far one of the BBC better series.. The whole cast were very convincing in the parts they portrayed and although the 3rd series was somewhat slower it was compelling viewing and my evenings wont be the same without it..

3,So grateful to the BBC for releasing this series on DVD and Video.,myself and 2 sisters watched all 3 series of Tenko and agree this is by far one of the BBC better series.. The whole cast were very convincing in the parts they portrayed and although the 3rd series was somewhat slower it was compelling viewing and my evenings wont be the same without it.. No doubt we will be watching it again as it is a series which I would never get sick of watching.. Excellent viewing and full marks to the BBC for such a brilliant series and the casting.. First rate in all departments and would recommend this series to anyone although some age limits must be considered because of some adult material..

4,None (Original Review),"The Internet Database lists this as a TV show. And yes, it was a series on MTV shown on the \Oddities\"""" program, after \""""The Head\"""" and before \""""Aeon Flux\"""" if I recall correctly. But the version I watched this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes.<br /><br />You have the story of the Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone. The Maxx is a super-hero or a bum, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a girl who should listen to less of The Smiths and Mr. Gone a guy who can't seem to keep his head on. And then there's the other weird creatures...<br /><br />I use \""""or\"""" with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams. Maybe they're all real or dreams. Maybe one of the characters doesn't exist. Maybe only one exists and dreams of the others. You'll have to wait and find out.<br /><br />I had the comic books before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites. The artwork was spectacular and the story was original -- unlike anything you'll find in Superman or Batman. It will bend your mind, and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive. And the show used basically the same exact artwork (only now it moves) and the same story... guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced. This was the best show to appear on \""""Oddities\"""", hands down.<br /><br />If you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip, this is a show to check out. It's \""""Donnie Darko\"""" before there was ever such a thing.<br /><br />The most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series, but I don't say this in disappointment.

4,The Internet Database lists this as a TV show.," And yes, it was a series on MTV shown on the \Oddities\"""" program, after \""""The Head\"""" and before \""""Aeon Flux\"""" if I recall correctly..  But the version I watched this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes.. <br /><br />You have the story of the Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone..  The Maxx is a super-hero or a bum, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a girl who should listen to less of The Smiths and Mr. Gone a guy who can't seem to keep his head on..  And then there's the other weird creatures.. .. .. <br /><br />I use \""""or\"""" with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams..  Maybe they're all real or dreams..  Maybe one of the characters doesn't exist..  Maybe only one exists and dreams of the others..  You'll have to wait and find out.. <br /><br />I had the comic books before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites..  The artwork was spectacular and the story was original -- unlike anything you'll find in Superman or Batman..  It will bend your mind, and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive..  And the show used basically the same exact artwork (only now it moves) and the same story.. .. ..  guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced..  This was the best show to appear on \""""Oddities\"""", hands down.. <br /><br />If you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip, this is a show to check out..  It's \""""Donnie Darko\"""" before there was ever such a thing.. <br /><br />The most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series, but I don't say this in disappointment..

4," And yes, it was a series on MTV shown on the \Oddities\"""" program, after \""""The Head\"""" and before \""""Aeon Flux\"""" if I recall correctly.","The Internet Database lists this as a TV show..  But the version I watched this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes.. <br /><br />You have the story of the Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone..  The Maxx is a super-hero or a bum, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a girl who should listen to less of The Smiths and Mr. Gone a guy who can't seem to keep his head on..  And then there's the other weird creatures.. .. .. <br /><br />I use \""""or\"""" with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams..  Maybe they're all real or dreams..  Maybe one of the characters doesn't exist..  Maybe only one exists and dreams of the others..  You'll have to wait and find out.. <br /><br />I had the comic books before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites..  The artwork was spectacular and the story was original -- unlike anything you'll find in Superman or Batman..  It will bend your mind, and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive..  And the show used basically the same exact artwork (only now it moves) and the same story.. .. ..  guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced..  This was the best show to appear on \""""Oddities\"""", hands down.. <br /><br />If you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip, this is a show to check out..  It's \""""Donnie Darko\"""" before there was ever such a thing.. <br /><br />The most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series, but I don't say this in disappointment..

4, But the version I watched this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes.,"The Internet Database lists this as a TV show..  And yes, it was a series on MTV shown on the \Oddities\"""" program, after \""""The Head\"""" and before \""""Aeon Flux\"""" if I recall correctly.. <br /><br />You have the story of the Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone..  The Maxx is a super-hero or a bum, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a girl who should listen to less of The Smiths and Mr. Gone a guy who can't seem to keep his head on..  And then there's the other weird creatures.. .. .. <br /><br />I use \""""or\"""" with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams..  Maybe they're all real or dreams..  Maybe one of the characters doesn't exist..  Maybe only one exists and dreams of the others..  You'll have to wait and find out.. <br /><br />I had the comic books before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites..  The artwork was spectacular and the story was original -- unlike anything you'll find in Superman or Batman..  It will bend your mind, and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive..  And the show used basically the same exact artwork (only now it moves) and the same story.. .. ..  guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced..  This was the best show to appear on \""""Oddities\"""", hands down.. <br /><br />If you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip, this is a show to check out..  It's \""""Donnie Darko\"""" before there was ever such a thing.. <br /><br />The most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series, but I don't say this in disappointment..

4,"<br /><br />You have the story of the Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone.","The Internet Database lists this as a TV show..  And yes, it was a series on MTV shown on the \Oddities\"""" program, after \""""The Head\"""" and before \""""Aeon Flux\"""" if I recall correctly..  But the version I watched this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes..  The Maxx is a super-hero or a bum, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a girl who should listen to less of The Smiths and Mr. Gone a guy who can't seem to keep his head on..  And then there's the other weird creatures.. .. .. <br /><br />I use \""""or\"""" with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams..  Maybe they're all real or dreams..  Maybe one of the characters doesn't exist..  Maybe only one exists and dreams of the others..  You'll have to wait and find out.. <br /><br />I had the comic books before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites..  The artwork was spectacular and the story was original -- unlike anything you'll find in Superman or Batman..  It will bend your mind, and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive..  And the show used basically the same exact artwork (only now it moves) and the same story.. .. ..  guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced..  This was the best show to appear on \""""Oddities\"""", hands down.. <br /><br />If you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip, this is a show to check out..  It's \""""Donnie Darko\"""" before there was ever such a thing.. <br /><br />The most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series, but I don't say this in disappointment..

4," The Maxx is a super-hero or a bum, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a girl who should listen to less of The Smiths and Mr. Gone a guy who can't seem to keep his head on.","The Internet Database lists this as a TV show..  And yes, it was a series on MTV shown on the \Oddities\"""" program, after \""""The Head\"""" and before \""""Aeon Flux\"""" if I recall correctly..  But the version I watched this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes.. <br /><br />You have the story of the Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone..  And then there's the other weird creatures.. .. .. <br /><br />I use \""""or\"""" with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams..  Maybe they're all real or dreams..  Maybe one of the characters doesn't exist..  Maybe only one exists and dreams of the others..  You'll have to wait and find out.. <br /><br />I had the comic books before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites..  The artwork was spectacular and the story was original -- unlike anything you'll find in Superman or Batman..  It will bend your mind, and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive..  And the show used basically the same exact artwork (only now it moves) and the same story.. .. ..  guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced..  This was the best show to appear on \""""Oddities\"""", hands down.. <br /><br />If you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip, this is a show to check out..  It's \""""Donnie Darko\"""" before there was ever such a thing.. <br /><br />The most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series, but I don't say this in disappointment..

4, And then there's the other weird creatures.,"The Internet Database lists this as a TV show..  And yes, it was a series on MTV shown on the \Oddities\"""" program, after \""""The Head\"""" and before \""""Aeon Flux\"""" if I recall correctly..  But the version I watched this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes.. <br /><br />You have the story of the Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone..  The Maxx is a super-hero or a bum, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a girl who should listen to less of The Smiths and Mr. Gone a guy who can't seem to keep his head on.. .. .. <br /><br />I use \""""or\"""" with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams..  Maybe they're all real or dreams..  Maybe one of the characters doesn't exist..  Maybe only one exists and dreams of the others..  You'll have to wait and find out.. <br /><br />I had the comic books before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites..  The artwork was spectacular and the story was original -- unlike anything you'll find in Superman or Batman..  It will bend your mind, and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive..  And the show used basically the same exact artwork (only now it moves) and the same story.. .. ..  guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced..  This was the best show to appear on \""""Oddities\"""", hands down.. <br /><br />If you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip, this is a show to check out..  It's \""""Donnie Darko\"""" before there was ever such a thing.. <br /><br />The most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series, but I don't say this in disappointment..

4,"<br /><br />I use \""""or\"""" with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams.","The Internet Database lists this as a TV show..  And yes, it was a series on MTV shown on the \Oddities\"""" program, after \""""The Head\"""" and before \""""Aeon Flux\"""" if I recall correctly..  But the version I watched this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes.. <br /><br />You have the story of the Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone..  The Maxx is a super-hero or a bum, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a girl who should listen to less of The Smiths and Mr. Gone a guy who can't seem to keep his head on..  And then there's the other weird creatures.. .. ..  Maybe they're all real or dreams..  Maybe one of the characters doesn't exist..  Maybe only one exists and dreams of the others..  You'll have to wait and find out.. <br /><br />I had the comic books before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites..  The artwork was spectacular and the story was original -- unlike anything you'll find in Superman or Batman..  It will bend your mind, and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive..  And the show used basically the same exact artwork (only now it moves) and the same story.. .. ..  guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced..  This was the best show to appear on \""""Oddities\"""", hands down.. <br /><br />If you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip, this is a show to check out..  It's \""""Donnie Darko\"""" before there was ever such a thing.. <br /><br />The most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series, but I don't say this in disappointment..

4, Maybe they're all real or dreams.,"The Internet Database lists this as a TV show..  And yes, it was a series on MTV shown on the \Oddities\"""" program, after \""""The Head\"""" and before \""""Aeon Flux\"""" if I recall correctly..  But the version I watched this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes.. <br /><br />You have the story of the Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone..  The Maxx is a super-hero or a bum, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a girl who should listen to less of The Smiths and Mr. Gone a guy who can't seem to keep his head on..  And then there's the other weird creatures.. .. .. <br /><br />I use \""""or\"""" with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams..  Maybe one of the characters doesn't exist..  Maybe only one exists and dreams of the others..  You'll have to wait and find out.. <br /><br />I had the comic books before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites..  The artwork was spectacular and the story was original -- unlike anything you'll find in Superman or Batman..  It will bend your mind, and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive..  And the show used basically the same exact artwork (only now it moves) and the same story.. .. ..  guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced..  This was the best show to appear on \""""Oddities\"""", hands down.. <br /><br />If you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip, this is a show to check out..  It's \""""Donnie Darko\"""" before there was ever such a thing.. <br /><br />The most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series, but I don't say this in disappointment..

4, Maybe one of the characters doesn't exist.,"The Internet Database lists this as a TV show..  And yes, it was a series on MTV shown on the \Oddities\"""" program, after \""""The Head\"""" and before \""""Aeon Flux\"""" if I recall correctly..  But the version I watched this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes.. <br /><br />You have the story of the Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone..  The Maxx is a super-hero or a bum, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a girl who should listen to less of The Smiths and Mr. Gone a guy who can't seem to keep his head on..  And then there's the other weird creatures.. .. .. <br /><br />I use \""""or\"""" with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams..  Maybe they're all real or dreams..  Maybe only one exists and dreams of the others..  You'll have to wait and find out.. <br /><br />I had the comic books before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites..  The artwork was spectacular and the story was original -- unlike anything you'll find in Superman or Batman..  It will bend your mind, and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive..  And the show used basically the same exact artwork (only now it moves) and the same story.. .. ..  guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced..  This was the best show to appear on \""""Oddities\"""", hands down.. <br /><br />If you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip, this is a show to check out..  It's \""""Donnie Darko\"""" before there was ever such a thing.. <br /><br />The most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series, but I don't say this in disappointment..

4, Maybe only one exists and dreams of the others.,"The Internet Database lists this as a TV show..  And yes, it was a series on MTV shown on the \Oddities\"""" program, after \""""The Head\"""" and before \""""Aeon Flux\"""" if I recall correctly..  But the version I watched this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes.. <br /><br />You have the story of the Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone..  The Maxx is a super-hero or a bum, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a girl who should listen to less of The Smiths and Mr. Gone a guy who can't seem to keep his head on..  And then there's the other weird creatures.. .. .. <br /><br />I use \""""or\"""" with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams..  Maybe they're all real or dreams..  Maybe one of the characters doesn't exist..  You'll have to wait and find out.. <br /><br />I had the comic books before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites..  The artwork was spectacular and the story was original -- unlike anything you'll find in Superman or Batman..  It will bend your mind, and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive..  And the show used basically the same exact artwork (only now it moves) and the same story.. .. ..  guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced..  This was the best show to appear on \""""Oddities\"""", hands down.. <br /><br />If you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip, this is a show to check out..  It's \""""Donnie Darko\"""" before there was ever such a thing.. <br /><br />The most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series, but I don't say this in disappointment..

4, You'll have to wait and find out.,"The Internet Database lists this as a TV show..  And yes, it was a series on MTV shown on the \Oddities\"""" program, after \""""The Head\"""" and before \""""Aeon Flux\"""" if I recall correctly..  But the version I watched this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes.. <br /><br />You have the story of the Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone..  The Maxx is a super-hero or a bum, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a girl who should listen to less of The Smiths and Mr. Gone a guy who can't seem to keep his head on..  And then there's the other weird creatures.. .. .. <br /><br />I use \""""or\"""" with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams..  Maybe they're all real or dreams..  Maybe one of the characters doesn't exist..  Maybe only one exists and dreams of the others.. <br /><br />I had the comic books before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites..  The artwork was spectacular and the story was original -- unlike anything you'll find in Superman or Batman..  It will bend your mind, and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive..  And the show used basically the same exact artwork (only now it moves) and the same story.. .. ..  guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced..  This was the best show to appear on \""""Oddities\"""", hands down.. <br /><br />If you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip, this is a show to check out..  It's \""""Donnie Darko\"""" before there was ever such a thing.. <br /><br />The most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series, but I don't say this in disappointment..

4,"<br /><br />I had the comic books before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites.","The Internet Database lists this as a TV show..  And yes, it was a series on MTV shown on the \Oddities\"""" program, after \""""The Head\"""" and before \""""Aeon Flux\"""" if I recall correctly..  But the version I watched this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes.. <br /><br />You have the story of the Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone..  The Maxx is a super-hero or a bum, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a girl who should listen to less of The Smiths and Mr. Gone a guy who can't seem to keep his head on..  And then there's the other weird creatures.. .. .. <br /><br />I use \""""or\"""" with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams..  Maybe they're all real or dreams..  Maybe one of the characters doesn't exist..  Maybe only one exists and dreams of the others..  You'll have to wait and find out..  The artwork was spectacular and the story was original -- unlike anything you'll find in Superman or Batman..  It will bend your mind, and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive..  And the show used basically the same exact artwork (only now it moves) and the same story.. .. ..  guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced..  This was the best show to appear on \""""Oddities\"""", hands down.. <br /><br />If you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip, this is a show to check out..  It's \""""Donnie Darko\"""" before there was ever such a thing.. <br /><br />The most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series, but I don't say this in disappointment..

4, The artwork was spectacular and the story was original -- unlike anything you'll find in Superman or Batman.,"The Internet Database lists this as a TV show..  And yes, it was a series on MTV shown on the \Oddities\"""" program, after \""""The Head\"""" and before \""""Aeon Flux\"""" if I recall correctly..  But the version I watched this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes.. <br /><br />You have the story of the Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone..  The Maxx is a super-hero or a bum, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a girl who should listen to less of The Smiths and Mr. Gone a guy who can't seem to keep his head on..  And then there's the other weird creatures.. .. .. <br /><br />I use \""""or\"""" with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams..  Maybe they're all real or dreams..  Maybe one of the characters doesn't exist..  Maybe only one exists and dreams of the others..  You'll have to wait and find out.. <br /><br />I had the comic books before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites..  It will bend your mind, and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive..  And the show used basically the same exact artwork (only now it moves) and the same story.. .. ..  guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced..  This was the best show to appear on \""""Oddities\"""", hands down.. <br /><br />If you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip, this is a show to check out..  It's \""""Donnie Darko\"""" before there was ever such a thing.. <br /><br />The most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series, but I don't say this in disappointment..

4," It will bend your mind, and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive.","The Internet Database lists this as a TV show..  And yes, it was a series on MTV shown on the \Oddities\"""" program, after \""""The Head\"""" and before \""""Aeon Flux\"""" if I recall correctly..  But the version I watched this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes.. <br /><br />You have the story of the Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone..  The Maxx is a super-hero or a bum, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a girl who should listen to less of The Smiths and Mr. Gone a guy who can't seem to keep his head on..  And then there's the other weird creatures.. .. .. <br /><br />I use \""""or\"""" with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams..  Maybe they're all real or dreams..  Maybe one of the characters doesn't exist..  Maybe only one exists and dreams of the others..  You'll have to wait and find out.. <br /><br />I had the comic books before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites..  The artwork was spectacular and the story was original -- unlike anything you'll find in Superman or Batman..  And the show used basically the same exact artwork (only now it moves) and the same story.. .. ..  guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced..  This was the best show to appear on \""""Oddities\"""", hands down.. <br /><br />If you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip, this is a show to check out..  It's \""""Donnie Darko\"""" before there was ever such a thing.. <br /><br />The most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series, but I don't say this in disappointment..

4, And the show used basically the same exact artwork (only now it moves) and the same story.,"The Internet Database lists this as a TV show..  And yes, it was a series on MTV shown on the \Oddities\"""" program, after \""""The Head\"""" and before \""""Aeon Flux\"""" if I recall correctly..  But the version I watched this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes.. <br /><br />You have the story of the Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone..  The Maxx is a super-hero or a bum, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a girl who should listen to less of The Smiths and Mr. Gone a guy who can't seem to keep his head on..  And then there's the other weird creatures.. .. .. <br /><br />I use \""""or\"""" with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams..  Maybe they're all real or dreams..  Maybe one of the characters doesn't exist..  Maybe only one exists and dreams of the others..  You'll have to wait and find out.. <br /><br />I had the comic books before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites..  The artwork was spectacular and the story was original -- unlike anything you'll find in Superman or Batman..  It will bend your mind, and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive.. .. ..  guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced..  This was the best show to appear on \""""Oddities\"""", hands down.. <br /><br />If you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip, this is a show to check out..  It's \""""Donnie Darko\"""" before there was ever such a thing.. <br /><br />The most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series, but I don't say this in disappointment..

4, guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced.,"The Internet Database lists this as a TV show..  And yes, it was a series on MTV shown on the \Oddities\"""" program, after \""""The Head\"""" and before \""""Aeon Flux\"""" if I recall correctly..  But the version I watched this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes.. <br /><br />You have the story of the Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone..  The Maxx is a super-hero or a bum, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a girl who should listen to less of The Smiths and Mr. Gone a guy who can't seem to keep his head on..  And then there's the other weird creatures.. .. .. <br /><br />I use \""""or\"""" with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams..  Maybe they're all real or dreams..  Maybe one of the characters doesn't exist..  Maybe only one exists and dreams of the others..  You'll have to wait and find out.. <br /><br />I had the comic books before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites..  The artwork was spectacular and the story was original -- unlike anything you'll find in Superman or Batman..  It will bend your mind, and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive..  And the show used basically the same exact artwork (only now it moves) and the same story.. .. ..  This was the best show to appear on \""""Oddities\"""", hands down.. <br /><br />If you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip, this is a show to check out..  It's \""""Donnie Darko\"""" before there was ever such a thing.. <br /><br />The most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series, but I don't say this in disappointment..

4," This was the best show to appear on \""""Oddities\"""", hands down.","The Internet Database lists this as a TV show..  And yes, it was a series on MTV shown on the \Oddities\"""" program, after \""""The Head\"""" and before \""""Aeon Flux\"""" if I recall correctly..  But the version I watched this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes.. <br /><br />You have the story of the Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone..  The Maxx is a super-hero or a bum, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a girl who should listen to less of The Smiths and Mr. Gone a guy who can't seem to keep his head on..  And then there's the other weird creatures.. .. .. <br /><br />I use \""""or\"""" with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams..  Maybe they're all real or dreams..  Maybe one of the characters doesn't exist..  Maybe only one exists and dreams of the others..  You'll have to wait and find out.. <br /><br />I had the comic books before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites..  The artwork was spectacular and the story was original -- unlike anything you'll find in Superman or Batman..  It will bend your mind, and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive..  And the show used basically the same exact artwork (only now it moves) and the same story.. .. ..  guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced.. <br /><br />If you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip, this is a show to check out..  It's \""""Donnie Darko\"""" before there was ever such a thing.. <br /><br />The most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series, but I don't say this in disappointment..

4,"<br /><br />If you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip, this is a show to check out.","The Internet Database lists this as a TV show..  And yes, it was a series on MTV shown on the \Oddities\"""" program, after \""""The Head\"""" and before \""""Aeon Flux\"""" if I recall correctly..  But the version I watched this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes.. <br /><br />You have the story of the Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone..  The Maxx is a super-hero or a bum, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a girl who should listen to less of The Smiths and Mr. Gone a guy who can't seem to keep his head on..  And then there's the other weird creatures.. .. .. <br /><br />I use \""""or\"""" with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams..  Maybe they're all real or dreams..  Maybe one of the characters doesn't exist..  Maybe only one exists and dreams of the others..  You'll have to wait and find out.. <br /><br />I had the comic books before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites..  The artwork was spectacular and the story was original -- unlike anything you'll find in Superman or Batman..  It will bend your mind, and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive..  And the show used basically the same exact artwork (only now it moves) and the same story.. .. ..  guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced..  This was the best show to appear on \""""Oddities\"""", hands down..  It's \""""Donnie Darko\"""" before there was ever such a thing.. <br /><br />The most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series, but I don't say this in disappointment..

4," It's \""""Donnie Darko\"""" before there was ever such a thing.","The Internet Database lists this as a TV show..  And yes, it was a series on MTV shown on the \Oddities\"""" program, after \""""The Head\"""" and before \""""Aeon Flux\"""" if I recall correctly..  But the version I watched this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes.. <br /><br />You have the story of the Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone..  The Maxx is a super-hero or a bum, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a girl who should listen to less of The Smiths and Mr. Gone a guy who can't seem to keep his head on..  And then there's the other weird creatures.. .. .. <br /><br />I use \""""or\"""" with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams..  Maybe they're all real or dreams..  Maybe one of the characters doesn't exist..  Maybe only one exists and dreams of the others..  You'll have to wait and find out.. <br /><br />I had the comic books before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites..  The artwork was spectacular and the story was original -- unlike anything you'll find in Superman or Batman..  It will bend your mind, and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive..  And the show used basically the same exact artwork (only now it moves) and the same story.. .. ..  guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced..  This was the best show to appear on \""""Oddities\"""", hands down.. <br /><br />If you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip, this is a show to check out.. <br /><br />The most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series, but I don't say this in disappointment..  By keeping it simple, they have sealed this movie in gold and kept it free from the blemishes brought on by successive failures..

4,"<br /><br />The most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series, but I don't say this in disappointment.","The Internet Database lists this as a TV show..  And yes, it was a series on MTV shown on the \Oddities\"""" program, after \""""The Head\"""" and before \""""Aeon Flux\"""" if I recall correctly..  But the version I watched this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes.. <br /><br />You have the story of the Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone..  The Maxx is a super-hero or a bum, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a girl who should listen to less of The Smiths and Mr. Gone a guy who can't seem to keep his head on..  And then there's the other weird creatures.. .. .. <br /><br />I use \""""or\"""" with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams..  Maybe they're all real or dreams..  Maybe one of the characters doesn't exist..  Maybe only one exists and dreams of the others..  You'll have to wait and find out.. <br /><br />I had the comic books before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites..  The artwork was spectacular and the story was original -- unlike anything you'll find in Superman or Batman..  It will bend your mind, and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive..  And the show used basically the same exact artwork (only now it moves) and the same story.. .. ..  guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced..  This was the best show to appear on \""""Oddities\"""", hands down.. <br /><br />If you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip, this is a show to check out..

4," By keeping it simple, they have sealed this movie in gold and kept it free from the blemishes brought on by successive failures.","The Internet Database lists this as a TV show..  And yes, it was a series on MTV shown on the \Oddities\"""" program, after \""""The Head\"""" and before \""""Aeon Flux\"""" if I recall correctly..  But the version I watched this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes.. <br /><br />You have the story of the Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone..  The Maxx is a super-hero or a bum, Julie a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah a girl who should listen to less of The Smiths and Mr. Gone a guy who can't seem to keep his head on..  And then there's the other weird creatures.. .. .. <br /><br />I use \""""or\"""" with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams..  Maybe they're all real or dreams..  Maybe one of the characters doesn't exist..  Maybe only one exists and dreams of the others..  You'll have to wait and find out.. <br /><br />I had the comic books before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites..  The artwork was spectacular and the story was original -- unlike anything you'll find in Superman or Batman..  It will bend your mind, and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive..  And the show used basically the same exact artwork (only now it moves) and the same story.. .. ..  guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced..  This was the best show to appear on \""""Oddities\"""", hands down.. <br /><br />If you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip, this is a show to check out..

5,None (Original Review),"Awful, confusing bit of crap from South of the Border. I've now watched it twice and I STILL don't really know what was going on. It had something to do with a stupid looking Aztec mummy, a 'human robot' that's the dumbest looking robot I've ever seen bar none, and a woman who is the reincarnation of some ancient Aztec chick. Most of the story is told in a painfully slow and droning manner by an incredibly dull scientist. This guy is a marvelous sleep aid. His nemesis is a fat slob called The Bat, which is a pretty unimaginative name for an evil scientist.<br /><br />I guess the boring scientist and his wormy assistant dug up the mummy, and what a shocker, the scientist's wife just HAPPENS to be the reincarnation of the mummy's girlfriend. They keep the mummy perpetually in a mausoleum for some reason, I guess so that the overacting bad guy can steal it. It takes him five years to do this, because he's inventing a 'human robot' to steal the mummy, or attack it, or whatever. He's after some treasure that the mummy has, so that he can be rich. But excuse me, if the guy had this huge an intellect and a strong drive to succeed, why didn't he just patent some of his ideas and get rich that way? <br /><br />Oh, well, I suppose that would make too much sense. Instead, there is ridiculous fight between the mummy and the robot, and it's really hard to tell which one is faker looking or more cheesy. To tell you the truth, I watched this because I thought a film with a name like The Robot Vs. the Aztec Mummy just HAD to be fabulously cheesy.

5,"Awful, confusing bit of crap from South of the Border."," I've now watched it twice and I STILL don't really know what was going on..  It had something to do with a stupid looking Aztec mummy, a 'human robot' that's the dumbest looking robot I've ever seen bar none, and a woman who is the reincarnation of some ancient Aztec chick..  Most of the story is told in a painfully slow and droning manner by an incredibly dull scientist..  This guy is a marvelous sleep aid..  His nemesis is a fat slob called The Bat, which is a pretty unimaginative name for an evil scientist.. <br /><br />I guess the boring scientist and his wormy assistant dug up the mummy, and what a shocker, the scientist's wife just HAPPENS to be the reincarnation of the mummy's girlfriend..  They keep the mummy perpetually in a mausoleum for some reason, I guess so that the overacting bad guy can steal it..  It takes him five years to do this, because he's inventing a 'human robot' to steal the mummy, or attack it, or whatever..  He's after some treasure that the mummy has, so that he can be rich..  But excuse me, if the guy had this huge an intellect and a strong drive to succeed, why didn't he just patent some of his ideas and get rich that way? <br /><br />Oh, well, I suppose that would make too much sense..  Instead, there is ridiculous fight between the mummy and the robot, and it's really hard to tell which one is faker looking or more cheesy..  To tell you the truth, I watched this because I thought a film with a name like The Robot Vs. the Aztec Mummy just HAD to be fabulously cheesy..

5, I've now watched it twice and I STILL don't really know what was going on.,"Awful, confusing bit of crap from South of the Border..  It had something to do with a stupid looking Aztec mummy, a 'human robot' that's the dumbest looking robot I've ever seen bar none, and a woman who is the reincarnation of some ancient Aztec chick..  Most of the story is told in a painfully slow and droning manner by an incredibly dull scientist..  This guy is a marvelous sleep aid..  His nemesis is a fat slob called The Bat, which is a pretty unimaginative name for an evil scientist.. <br /><br />I guess the boring scientist and his wormy assistant dug up the mummy, and what a shocker, the scientist's wife just HAPPENS to be the reincarnation of the mummy's girlfriend..  They keep the mummy perpetually in a mausoleum for some reason, I guess so that the overacting bad guy can steal it..  It takes him five years to do this, because he's inventing a 'human robot' to steal the mummy, or attack it, or whatever..  He's after some treasure that the mummy has, so that he can be rich..  But excuse me, if the guy had this huge an intellect and a strong drive to succeed, why didn't he just patent some of his ideas and get rich that way? <br /><br />Oh, well, I suppose that would make too much sense..  Instead, there is ridiculous fight between the mummy and the robot, and it's really hard to tell which one is faker looking or more cheesy..  To tell you the truth, I watched this because I thought a film with a name like The Robot Vs. the Aztec Mummy just HAD to be fabulously cheesy..

5," It had something to do with a stupid looking Aztec mummy, a 'human robot' that's the dumbest looking robot I've ever seen bar none, and a woman who is the reincarnation of some ancient Aztec chick.","Awful, confusing bit of crap from South of the Border..  I've now watched it twice and I STILL don't really know what was going on..  Most of the story is told in a painfully slow and droning manner by an incredibly dull scientist..  This guy is a marvelous sleep aid..  His nemesis is a fat slob called The Bat, which is a pretty unimaginative name for an evil scientist.. <br /><br />I guess the boring scientist and his wormy assistant dug up the mummy, and what a shocker, the scientist's wife just HAPPENS to be the reincarnation of the mummy's girlfriend..  They keep the mummy perpetually in a mausoleum for some reason, I guess so that the overacting bad guy can steal it..  It takes him five years to do this, because he's inventing a 'human robot' to steal the mummy, or attack it, or whatever..  He's after some treasure that the mummy has, so that he can be rich..  But excuse me, if the guy had this huge an intellect and a strong drive to succeed, why didn't he just patent some of his ideas and get rich that way? <br /><br />Oh, well, I suppose that would make too much sense..  Instead, there is ridiculous fight between the mummy and the robot, and it's really hard to tell which one is faker looking or more cheesy..  To tell you the truth, I watched this because I thought a film with a name like The Robot Vs. the Aztec Mummy just HAD to be fabulously cheesy..

5, Most of the story is told in a painfully slow and droning manner by an incredibly dull scientist.,"Awful, confusing bit of crap from South of the Border..  I've now watched it twice and I STILL don't really know what was going on..  It had something to do with a stupid looking Aztec mummy, a 'human robot' that's the dumbest looking robot I've ever seen bar none, and a woman who is the reincarnation of some ancient Aztec chick..  This guy is a marvelous sleep aid..  His nemesis is a fat slob called The Bat, which is a pretty unimaginative name for an evil scientist.. <br /><br />I guess the boring scientist and his wormy assistant dug up the mummy, and what a shocker, the scientist's wife just HAPPENS to be the reincarnation of the mummy's girlfriend..  They keep the mummy perpetually in a mausoleum for some reason, I guess so that the overacting bad guy can steal it..  It takes him five years to do this, because he's inventing a 'human robot' to steal the mummy, or attack it, or whatever..  He's after some treasure that the mummy has, so that he can be rich..  But excuse me, if the guy had this huge an intellect and a strong drive to succeed, why didn't he just patent some of his ideas and get rich that way? <br /><br />Oh, well, I suppose that would make too much sense..  Instead, there is ridiculous fight between the mummy and the robot, and it's really hard to tell which one is faker looking or more cheesy..  To tell you the truth, I watched this because I thought a film with a name like The Robot Vs. the Aztec Mummy just HAD to be fabulously cheesy..

5, This guy is a marvelous sleep aid.,"Awful, confusing bit of crap from South of the Border..  I've now watched it twice and I STILL don't really know what was going on..  It had something to do with a stupid looking Aztec mummy, a 'human robot' that's the dumbest looking robot I've ever seen bar none, and a woman who is the reincarnation of some ancient Aztec chick..  Most of the story is told in a painfully slow and droning manner by an incredibly dull scientist..  His nemesis is a fat slob called The Bat, which is a pretty unimaginative name for an evil scientist.. <br /><br />I guess the boring scientist and his wormy assistant dug up the mummy, and what a shocker, the scientist's wife just HAPPENS to be the reincarnation of the mummy's girlfriend..  They keep the mummy perpetually in a mausoleum for some reason, I guess so that the overacting bad guy can steal it..  It takes him five years to do this, because he's inventing a 'human robot' to steal the mummy, or attack it, or whatever..  He's after some treasure that the mummy has, so that he can be rich..  But excuse me, if the guy had this huge an intellect and a strong drive to succeed, why didn't he just patent some of his ideas and get rich that way? <br /><br />Oh, well, I suppose that would make too much sense..  Instead, there is ridiculous fight between the mummy and the robot, and it's really hard to tell which one is faker looking or more cheesy..  To tell you the truth, I watched this because I thought a film with a name like The Robot Vs. the Aztec Mummy just HAD to be fabulously cheesy..

5," His nemesis is a fat slob called The Bat, which is a pretty unimaginative name for an evil scientist.","Awful, confusing bit of crap from South of the Border..  I've now watched it twice and I STILL don't really know what was going on..  It had something to do with a stupid looking Aztec mummy, a 'human robot' that's the dumbest looking robot I've ever seen bar none, and a woman who is the reincarnation of some ancient Aztec chick..  Most of the story is told in a painfully slow and droning manner by an incredibly dull scientist..  This guy is a marvelous sleep aid.. <br /><br />I guess the boring scientist and his wormy assistant dug up the mummy, and what a shocker, the scientist's wife just HAPPENS to be the reincarnation of the mummy's girlfriend..  They keep the mummy perpetually in a mausoleum for some reason, I guess so that the overacting bad guy can steal it..  It takes him five years to do this, because he's inventing a 'human robot' to steal the mummy, or attack it, or whatever..  He's after some treasure that the mummy has, so that he can be rich..  But excuse me, if the guy had this huge an intellect and a strong drive to succeed, why didn't he just patent some of his ideas and get rich that way? <br /><br />Oh, well, I suppose that would make too much sense..  Instead, there is ridiculous fight between the mummy and the robot, and it's really hard to tell which one is faker looking or more cheesy..  To tell you the truth, I watched this because I thought a film with a name like The Robot Vs. the Aztec Mummy just HAD to be fabulously cheesy..

5,"<br /><br />I guess the boring scientist and his wormy assistant dug up the mummy, and what a shocker, the scientist's wife just HAPPENS to be the reincarnation of the mummy's girlfriend.","Awful, confusing bit of crap from South of the Border..  I've now watched it twice and I STILL don't really know what was going on..  It had something to do with a stupid looking Aztec mummy, a 'human robot' that's the dumbest looking robot I've ever seen bar none, and a woman who is the reincarnation of some ancient Aztec chick..  Most of the story is told in a painfully slow and droning manner by an incredibly dull scientist..  This guy is a marvelous sleep aid..  His nemesis is a fat slob called The Bat, which is a pretty unimaginative name for an evil scientist..  They keep the mummy perpetually in a mausoleum for some reason, I guess so that the overacting bad guy can steal it..  It takes him five years to do this, because he's inventing a 'human robot' to steal the mummy, or attack it, or whatever..  He's after some treasure that the mummy has, so that he can be rich..  But excuse me, if the guy had this huge an intellect and a strong drive to succeed, why didn't he just patent some of his ideas and get rich that way? <br /><br />Oh, well, I suppose that would make too much sense..  Instead, there is ridiculous fight between the mummy and the robot, and it's really hard to tell which one is faker looking or more cheesy..  To tell you the truth, I watched this because I thought a film with a name like The Robot Vs. the Aztec Mummy just HAD to be fabulously cheesy..

5," They keep the mummy perpetually in a mausoleum for some reason, I guess so that the overacting bad guy can steal it.","Awful, confusing bit of crap from South of the Border..  I've now watched it twice and I STILL don't really know what was going on..  It had something to do with a stupid looking Aztec mummy, a 'human robot' that's the dumbest looking robot I've ever seen bar none, and a woman who is the reincarnation of some ancient Aztec chick..  Most of the story is told in a painfully slow and droning manner by an incredibly dull scientist..  This guy is a marvelous sleep aid..  His nemesis is a fat slob called The Bat, which is a pretty unimaginative name for an evil scientist.. <br /><br />I guess the boring scientist and his wormy assistant dug up the mummy, and what a shocker, the scientist's wife just HAPPENS to be the reincarnation of the mummy's girlfriend..  It takes him five years to do this, because he's inventing a 'human robot' to steal the mummy, or attack it, or whatever..  He's after some treasure that the mummy has, so that he can be rich..  But excuse me, if the guy had this huge an intellect and a strong drive to succeed, why didn't he just patent some of his ideas and get rich that way? <br /><br />Oh, well, I suppose that would make too much sense..  Instead, there is ridiculous fight between the mummy and the robot, and it's really hard to tell which one is faker looking or more cheesy..  To tell you the truth, I watched this because I thought a film with a name like The Robot Vs. the Aztec Mummy just HAD to be fabulously cheesy..

5," It takes him five years to do this, because he's inventing a 'human robot' to steal the mummy, or attack it, or whatever.","Awful, confusing bit of crap from South of the Border..  I've now watched it twice and I STILL don't really know what was going on..  It had something to do with a stupid looking Aztec mummy, a 'human robot' that's the dumbest looking robot I've ever seen bar none, and a woman who is the reincarnation of some ancient Aztec chick..  Most of the story is told in a painfully slow and droning manner by an incredibly dull scientist..  This guy is a marvelous sleep aid..  His nemesis is a fat slob called The Bat, which is a pretty unimaginative name for an evil scientist.. <br /><br />I guess the boring scientist and his wormy assistant dug up the mummy, and what a shocker, the scientist's wife just HAPPENS to be the reincarnation of the mummy's girlfriend..  They keep the mummy perpetually in a mausoleum for some reason, I guess so that the overacting bad guy can steal it..  He's after some treasure that the mummy has, so that he can be rich..  But excuse me, if the guy had this huge an intellect and a strong drive to succeed, why didn't he just patent some of his ideas and get rich that way? <br /><br />Oh, well, I suppose that would make too much sense..  Instead, there is ridiculous fight between the mummy and the robot, and it's really hard to tell which one is faker looking or more cheesy..  To tell you the truth, I watched this because I thought a film with a name like The Robot Vs. the Aztec Mummy just HAD to be fabulously cheesy..

5," He's after some treasure that the mummy has, so that he can be rich.","Awful, confusing bit of crap from South of the Border..  I've now watched it twice and I STILL don't really know what was going on..  It had something to do with a stupid looking Aztec mummy, a 'human robot' that's the dumbest looking robot I've ever seen bar none, and a woman who is the reincarnation of some ancient Aztec chick..  Most of the story is told in a painfully slow and droning manner by an incredibly dull scientist..  This guy is a marvelous sleep aid..  His nemesis is a fat slob called The Bat, which is a pretty unimaginative name for an evil scientist.. <br /><br />I guess the boring scientist and his wormy assistant dug up the mummy, and what a shocker, the scientist's wife just HAPPENS to be the reincarnation of the mummy's girlfriend..  They keep the mummy perpetually in a mausoleum for some reason, I guess so that the overacting bad guy can steal it..  It takes him five years to do this, because he's inventing a 'human robot' to steal the mummy, or attack it, or whatever..  But excuse me, if the guy had this huge an intellect and a strong drive to succeed, why didn't he just patent some of his ideas and get rich that way? <br /><br />Oh, well, I suppose that would make too much sense..  Instead, there is ridiculous fight between the mummy and the robot, and it's really hard to tell which one is faker looking or more cheesy..  To tell you the truth, I watched this because I thought a film with a name like The Robot Vs. the Aztec Mummy just HAD to be fabulously cheesy..

5," But excuse me, if the guy had this huge an intellect and a strong drive to succeed, why didn't he just patent some of his ideas and get rich that way? <br /><br />Oh, well, I suppose that would make too much sense.","Awful, confusing bit of crap from South of the Border..  I've now watched it twice and I STILL don't really know what was going on..  It had something to do with a stupid looking Aztec mummy, a 'human robot' that's the dumbest looking robot I've ever seen bar none, and a woman who is the reincarnation of some ancient Aztec chick..  Most of the story is told in a painfully slow and droning manner by an incredibly dull scientist..  This guy is a marvelous sleep aid..  His nemesis is a fat slob called The Bat, which is a pretty unimaginative name for an evil scientist.. <br /><br />I guess the boring scientist and his wormy assistant dug up the mummy, and what a shocker, the scientist's wife just HAPPENS to be the reincarnation of the mummy's girlfriend..  They keep the mummy perpetually in a mausoleum for some reason, I guess so that the overacting bad guy can steal it..  It takes him five years to do this, because he's inventing a 'human robot' to steal the mummy, or attack it, or whatever..  He's after some treasure that the mummy has, so that he can be rich..  Instead, there is ridiculous fight between the mummy and the robot, and it's really hard to tell which one is faker looking or more cheesy..  To tell you the truth, I watched this because I thought a film with a name like The Robot Vs. the Aztec Mummy just HAD to be fabulously cheesy..

5," Instead, there is ridiculous fight between the mummy and the robot, and it's really hard to tell which one is faker looking or more cheesy.","Awful, confusing bit of crap from South of the Border..  I've now watched it twice and I STILL don't really know what was going on..  It had something to do with a stupid looking Aztec mummy, a 'human robot' that's the dumbest looking robot I've ever seen bar none, and a woman who is the reincarnation of some ancient Aztec chick..  Most of the story is told in a painfully slow and droning manner by an incredibly dull scientist..  This guy is a marvelous sleep aid..  His nemesis is a fat slob called The Bat, which is a pretty unimaginative name for an evil scientist.. <br /><br />I guess the boring scientist and his wormy assistant dug up the mummy, and what a shocker, the scientist's wife just HAPPENS to be the reincarnation of the mummy's girlfriend..  They keep the mummy perpetually in a mausoleum for some reason, I guess so that the overacting bad guy can steal it..  It takes him five years to do this, because he's inventing a 'human robot' to steal the mummy, or attack it, or whatever..  He's after some treasure that the mummy has, so that he can be rich..  But excuse me, if the guy had this huge an intellect and a strong drive to succeed, why didn't he just patent some of his ideas and get rich that way? <br /><br />Oh, well, I suppose that would make too much sense..  To tell you the truth, I watched this because I thought a film with a name like The Robot Vs. the Aztec Mummy just HAD to be fabulously cheesy..

5," To tell you the truth, I watched this because I thought a film with a name like The Robot Vs. the Aztec Mummy just HAD to be fabulously cheesy.","Awful, confusing bit of crap from South of the Border..  I've now watched it twice and I STILL don't really know what was going on..  It had something to do with a stupid looking Aztec mummy, a 'human robot' that's the dumbest looking robot I've ever seen bar none, and a woman who is the reincarnation of some ancient Aztec chick..  Most of the story is told in a painfully slow and droning manner by an incredibly dull scientist..  This guy is a marvelous sleep aid..  His nemesis is a fat slob called The Bat, which is a pretty unimaginative name for an evil scientist.. <br /><br />I guess the boring scientist and his wormy assistant dug up the mummy, and what a shocker, the scientist's wife just HAPPENS to be the reincarnation of the mummy's girlfriend..  They keep the mummy perpetually in a mausoleum for some reason, I guess so that the overacting bad guy can steal it..  It takes him five years to do this, because he's inventing a 'human robot' to steal the mummy, or attack it, or whatever..  He's after some treasure that the mummy has, so that he can be rich..  But excuse me, if the guy had this huge an intellect and a strong drive to succeed, why didn't he just patent some of his ideas and get rich that way? <br /><br />Oh, well, I suppose that would make too much sense..  Instead, there is ridiculous fight between the mummy and the robot, and it's really hard to tell which one is faker looking or more cheesy..

5, Instead it was just dully awful and mind blowingly confusing.,"Awful, confusing bit of crap from South of the Border..  I've now watched it twice and I STILL don't really know what was going on..  It had something to do with a stupid looking Aztec mummy, a 'human robot' that's the dumbest looking robot I've ever seen bar none, and a woman who is the reincarnation of some ancient Aztec chick..  Most of the story is told in a painfully slow and droning manner by an incredibly dull scientist..  This guy is a marvelous sleep aid..  His nemesis is a fat slob called The Bat, which is a pretty unimaginative name for an evil scientist.. <br /><br />I guess the boring scientist and his wormy assistant dug up the mummy, and what a shocker, the scientist's wife just HAPPENS to be the reincarnation of the mummy's girlfriend..  They keep the mummy perpetually in a mausoleum for some reason, I guess so that the overacting bad guy can steal it..  It takes him five years to do this, because he's inventing a 'human robot' to steal the mummy, or attack it, or whatever..  He's after some treasure that the mummy has, so that he can be rich..  But excuse me, if the guy had this huge an intellect and a strong drive to succeed, why didn't he just patent some of his ideas and get rich that way? <br /><br />Oh, well, I suppose that would make too much sense..  Instead, there is ridiculous fight between the mummy and the robot, and it's really hard to tell which one is faker looking or more cheesy..

6,None (Original Review),"I found myself very caught up in this movie, at least at the beginning, and any credit I give to this movie, is Lacey Chabert, she was fantastic!! But thats where it ends. I seem to be very good at figuring out who the killer is, and I like it when a movie is able to completely baffel me, but I felt out and out lied to, they whole time they lead you in one direction and then suddenly they decided to go in a completely different direction at the end, they gave no hit to it at all, thats not misleading that very bad writing and planning, someone did not think at

6,"I found myself very caught up in this movie, at least at the beginning, and any credit I give to this movie, is Lacey Chabert, she was fantastic!! But thats where it ends."," I seem to be very good at figuring out who the killer is, and I like it when a movie is able to completely baffel me, but I felt out and out lied to, they whole time they lead you in one direction and then suddenly they decided to go in a completely different direction at the end, they gave no hit to it at all, thats not misleading that very bad writing and planning, someone did not think at all!<br /><br />I felt the movie would have been much better if they had stuck to the plot that the lead you on, they also seemed to not answer anything, why did Jane(maria) burn down the professor's house.. <br /><br />Its a great pity as I felt it started out as a relatively good movie..

6," I seem to be very good at figuring out who the killer is, and I like it when a movie is able to completely baffel me, but I felt out and out lied to, they whole time they lead you in one direction and then suddenly they decided to go in a completely different direction at the end, they gave no hit to it at all, thats not misleading that very bad writing and planning, someone did not think at all!<br /><br />I felt the movie would have been much better if they had stuck to the plot that the lead you on, they also seemed to not answer anything, why did Jane(maria) burn down the professor's house.","I found myself very caught up in this movie, at least at the beginning, and any credit I give to this movie, is Lacey Chabert, she was fantastic!! But thats where it ends.. <br /><br />Its a great pity as I felt it started out as a relatively good movie..

6,<br /><br />Its a great pity as I felt it started out as a relatively good movie.,"I found myself very caught up in this movie, at least at the beginning, and any credit I give to this movie, is Lacey Chabert, she was fantastic!! But thats where it ends..  I seem to be very good at figuring out who the killer is, and I like it when a movie is able to completely baffel me, but I felt out and out lied to, they whole time they lead you in one direction and then suddenly they decided to go in a completely different direction at the end, they gave no hit to it at all, thats not misleading that very bad writing and planning, someone did not think at all!<br /><br />I felt the movie would have been much better if they had stuck to the plot that the lead you on, they also seemed to not answer anything, why did Jane(maria) burn down the professor's house..

7,None (Original Review),"Stephen King TV movies can go 5 or 6 parts and no one complains, right? So why give the Stooges only 96 minutes? I'm not asking for a PBS mini-series, but would a two parter had killed anyone? The movie steamrolled over events that should have been mentioned and mentioned events that could have been omitted. I do want to give a salute to the performances of the stars...they had a tough job because they didn't really look like the Stooges, but the spirit was there. After watching the movie, I pulled out a tape from American Movie Classics that had the real deal on it and laughed myself silly. The movie was pretty tough emotionally, especially after Curly has the stroke and Moe needs to keep the business going. When Curley started crying I lost it...Like I said, the movie was good, but could have been and SHOULD have been much, much better.

7,"Stephen King TV movies can go 5 or 6 parts and no one complains, right? So why give the Stooges only 96 minutes? I'm not asking for a PBS mini-series, but would a two parter had killed anyone? The movie steamrolled over events that should have been mentioned and mentioned events that could have been omitted."," I do want to give a salute to the performances of the stars.. .. .. they had a tough job because they didn't really look like the Stooges, but the spirit was there..  After watching the movie, I pulled out a tape from American Movie Classics that had the real deal on it and laughed myself silly..  The movie was pretty tough emotionally, especially after Curly has the stroke and Moe needs to keep the business going..  When Curley started crying I lost it.. .. .. Like I said, the movie was good, but could have been and SHOULD have been much, much better..

7, I do want to give a salute to the performances of the stars.,"Stephen King TV movies can go 5 or 6 parts and no one complains, right? So why give the Stooges only 96 minutes? I'm not asking for a PBS mini-series, but would a two parter had killed anyone? The movie steamrolled over events that should have been mentioned and mentioned events that could have been omitted.. .. .. they had a tough job because they didn't really look like the Stooges, but the spirit was there..  After watching the movie, I pulled out a tape from American Movie Classics that had the real deal on it and laughed myself silly..  The movie was pretty tough emotionally, especially after Curly has the stroke and Moe needs to keep the business going..  When Curley started crying I lost it.. .. .. Like I said, the movie was good, but could have been and SHOULD have been much, much better..

7,"they had a tough job because they didn't really look like the Stooges, but the spirit was there.","Stephen King TV movies can go 5 or 6 parts and no one complains, right? So why give the Stooges only 96 minutes? I'm not asking for a PBS mini-series, but would a two parter had killed anyone? The movie steamrolled over events that should have been mentioned and mentioned events that could have been omitted..  I do want to give a salute to the performances of the stars.. .. ..  After watching the movie, I pulled out a tape from American Movie Classics that had the real deal on it and laughed myself silly..  The movie was pretty tough emotionally, especially after Curly has the stroke and Moe needs to keep the business going..  When Curley started crying I lost it.. .. .. Like I said, the movie was good, but could have been and SHOULD have been much, much better..

7," After watching the movie, I pulled out a tape from American Movie Classics that had the real deal on it and laughed myself silly.","Stephen King TV movies can go 5 or 6 parts and no one complains, right? So why give the Stooges only 96 minutes? I'm not asking for a PBS mini-series, but would a two parter had killed anyone? The movie steamrolled over events that should have been mentioned and mentioned events that could have been omitted..  I do want to give a salute to the performances of the stars.. .. .. they had a tough job because they didn't really look like the Stooges, but the spirit was there..  The movie was pretty tough emotionally, especially after Curly has the stroke and Moe needs to keep the business going..  When Curley started crying I lost it.. .. .. Like I said, the movie was good, but could have been and SHOULD have been much, much better..

7," The movie was pretty tough emotionally, especially after Curly has the stroke and Moe needs to keep the business going.","Stephen King TV movies can go 5 or 6 parts and no one complains, right? So why give the Stooges only 96 minutes? I'm not asking for a PBS mini-series, but would a two parter had killed anyone? The movie steamrolled over events that should have been mentioned and mentioned events that could have been omitted..  I do want to give a salute to the performances of the stars.. .. .. they had a tough job because they didn't really look like the Stooges, but the spirit was there..  After watching the movie, I pulled out a tape from American Movie Classics that had the real deal on it and laughed myself silly..  When Curley started crying I lost it.. .. .. Like I said, the movie was good, but could have been and SHOULD have been much, much better..

7, When Curley started crying I lost it.,"Stephen King TV movies can go 5 or 6 parts and no one complains, right? So why give the Stooges only 96 minutes? I'm not asking for a PBS mini-series, but would a two parter had killed anyone? The movie steamrolled over events that should have been mentioned and mentioned events that could have been omitted..  I do want to give a salute to the performances of the stars.. .. .. they had a tough job because they didn't really look like the Stooges, but the spirit was there..  After watching the movie, I pulled out a tape from American Movie Classics that had the real deal on it and laughed myself silly..  The movie was pretty tough emotionally, especially after Curly has the stroke and Moe needs to keep the business going.. .. .. Like I said, the movie was good, but could have been and SHOULD have been much, much better..

7,"Like I said, the movie was good, but could have been and SHOULD have been much, much better.","Stephen King TV movies can go 5 or 6 parts and no one complains, right? So why give the Stooges only 96 minutes? I'm not asking for a PBS mini-series, but would a two parter had killed anyone? The movie steamrolled over events that should have been mentioned and mentioned events that could have been omitted..  I do want to give a salute to the performances of the stars.. .. .. they had a tough job because they didn't really look like the Stooges, but the spirit was there..  After watching the movie, I pulled out a tape from American Movie Classics that had the real deal on it and laughed myself silly..  The movie was pretty tough emotionally, especially after Curly has the stroke and Moe needs to keep the business going..  When Curley started crying I lost it.. .. ..

7, Maybe it's fitting though.,"Stephen King TV movies can go 5 or 6 parts and no one complains, right? So why give the Stooges only 96 minutes? I'm not asking for a PBS mini-series, but would a two parter had killed anyone? The movie steamrolled over events that should have been mentioned and mentioned events that could have been omitted..  I do want to give a salute to the performances of the stars.. .. .. they had a tough job because they didn't really look like the Stooges, but the spirit was there..  After watching the movie, I pulled out a tape from American Movie Classics that had the real deal on it and laughed myself silly..  The movie was pretty tough emotionally, especially after Curly has the stroke and Moe needs to keep the business going..  When Curley started crying I lost it.. .. ..

7,"the Stooges got ripped off when they were alive and now, 25 years later, it happens again.","Stephen King TV movies can go 5 or 6 parts and no one complains, right? So why give the Stooges only 96 minutes? I'm not asking for a PBS mini-series, but would a two parter had killed anyone? The movie steamrolled over events that should have been mentioned and mentioned events that could have been omitted..  I do want to give a salute to the performances of the stars.. .. .. they had a tough job because they didn't really look like the Stooges, but the spirit was there..  After watching the movie, I pulled out a tape from American Movie Classics that had the real deal on it and laughed myself silly..  The movie was pretty tough emotionally, especially after Curly has the stroke and Moe needs to keep the business going..  When Curley started crying I lost it.. .. ..

8,None (Original Review),"I had some time to kill before watching football so I saw this movie being offered on the scifi channel and it literally after watching it I thought I had encountered my version of mentally walking the Bataan death march as my conscious was beaten into submission by the awful movie which ripped off the Mummy series and Jurassic Park. It was so bad that I thought the opening credits were the highlight of the movie and then it went into such a abysmal descent that it made the recent drop in the stock market seem like a hiccup. The acting was so bad that I was hoping that one and all would be buried at the end. The lead by Casper Van Dien made me long for the high caliber acting of Steven Seagal in \On Deadly Ground\"""" as his line reading was so wooden that Woody Woodpecker was thinking of making a cameo to sit on his shoulder. I also noticed that his emotional range is so limited that I was under the impression my kitten was more expressive when asking for popcorn to eat . The direction was so abysmal I looked back yearning to my nephew's grade 3 play recital which had more pace and better vision and the fact that this movie seems to be have spliced together from afterthoughts of the aforementioned movie franchise it can not even be thought of as a homage. The FX of the movie was so bad that I thought the director and producers were enviormentally friendly by recycling cheap special effects from grade Z horror flicks from yesteryear. What Robert Wagner, Tom Bosley and Geoffrey Lewis were doing in this movies is beyond me and they should look at litigation against their agents for misrepresentation for getting them involved with such a dreck of a movie. My warning to one and all is watch this movie at your peril as this movie may cause your IQ to diminish with prolonged viewing. On a side note I noticed at IMDb that sometimes salaries for movies are published I was wondering if their is a way that actors that should give the salaries back for their poor performances in such movies.

8,I had some time to kill before watching football so I saw this movie being offered on the scifi channel and it literally after watching it I thought I had encountered my version of mentally walking the Bataan death march as my conscious was beaten into submission by the awful movie which ripped off the Mummy series and Jurassic Park.," It was so bad that I thought the opening credits were the highlight of the movie and then it went into such a abysmal descent that it made the recent drop in the stock market seem like a hiccup..  The acting was so bad that I was hoping that one and all would be buried at the end..  The lead by Casper Van Dien made me long for the high caliber acting of Steven Seagal in \On Deadly Ground\"""" as his line reading was so wooden that Woody Woodpecker was thinking of making a cameo to sit on his shoulder..  I also noticed that his emotional range is so limited that I was under the impression my kitten was more expressive when asking for popcorn to eat ..  The direction was so abysmal I looked back yearning to my nephew's grade 3 play recital which had more pace and better vision and the fact that this movie seems to be have spliced together from afterthoughts of the aforementioned movie franchise it can not even be thought of as a homage..  The FX of the movie was so bad that I thought the director and producers were enviormentally friendly by recycling cheap special effects from grade Z horror flicks from yesteryear..  What Robert Wagner, Tom Bosley and Geoffrey Lewis were doing in this movies is beyond me and they should look at litigation against their agents for misrepresentation for getting them involved with such a dreck of a movie..  My warning to one and all is watch this movie at your peril as this movie may cause your IQ to diminish with prolonged viewing..  On a side note I noticed at IMDb that sometimes salaries for movies are published I was wondering if their is a way that actors that should give the salaries back for their poor performances in such movies..

8, It was so bad that I thought the opening credits were the highlight of the movie and then it went into such a abysmal descent that it made the recent drop in the stock market seem like a hiccup.,"I had some time to kill before watching football so I saw this movie being offered on the scifi channel and it literally after watching it I thought I had encountered my version of mentally walking the Bataan death march as my conscious was beaten into submission by the awful movie which ripped off the Mummy series and Jurassic Park..  The acting was so bad that I was hoping that one and all would be buried at the end..  The lead by Casper Van Dien made me long for the high caliber acting of Steven Seagal in \On Deadly Ground\"""" as his line reading was so wooden that Woody Woodpecker was thinking of making a cameo to sit on his shoulder..  I also noticed that his emotional range is so limited that I was under the impression my kitten was more expressive when asking for popcorn to eat ..  The direction was so abysmal I looked back yearning to my nephew's grade 3 play recital which had more pace and better vision and the fact that this movie seems to be have spliced together from afterthoughts of the aforementioned movie franchise it can not even be thought of as a homage..  The FX of the movie was so bad that I thought the director and producers were enviormentally friendly by recycling cheap special effects from grade Z horror flicks from yesteryear..  What Robert Wagner, Tom Bosley and Geoffrey Lewis were doing in this movies is beyond me and they should look at litigation against their agents for misrepresentation for getting them involved with such a dreck of a movie..  My warning to one and all is watch this movie at your peril as this movie may cause your IQ to diminish with prolonged viewing..  On a side note I noticed at IMDb that sometimes salaries for movies are published I was wondering if their is a way that actors that should give the salaries back for their poor performances in such movies..

8, The acting was so bad that I was hoping that one and all would be buried at the end.,"I had some time to kill before watching football so I saw this movie being offered on the scifi channel and it literally after watching it I thought I had encountered my version of mentally walking the Bataan death march as my conscious was beaten into submission by the awful movie which ripped off the Mummy series and Jurassic Park..  It was so bad that I thought the opening credits were the highlight of the movie and then it went into such a abysmal descent that it made the recent drop in the stock market seem like a hiccup..  The lead by Casper Van Dien made me long for the high caliber acting of Steven Seagal in \On Deadly Ground\"""" as his line reading was so wooden that Woody Woodpecker was thinking of making a cameo to sit on his shoulder..  I also noticed that his emotional range is so limited that I was under the impression my kitten was more expressive when asking for popcorn to eat ..  The direction was so abysmal I looked back yearning to my nephew's grade 3 play recital which had more pace and better vision and the fact that this movie seems to be have spliced together from afterthoughts of the aforementioned movie franchise it can not even be thought of as a homage..  The FX of the movie was so bad that I thought the director and producers were enviormentally friendly by recycling cheap special effects from grade Z horror flicks from yesteryear..  What Robert Wagner, Tom Bosley and Geoffrey Lewis were doing in this movies is beyond me and they should look at litigation against their agents for misrepresentation for getting them involved with such a dreck of a movie..  My warning to one and all is watch this movie at your peril as this movie may cause your IQ to diminish with prolonged viewing..  On a side note I noticed at IMDb that sometimes salaries for movies are published I was wondering if their is a way that actors that should give the salaries back for their poor performances in such movies..

8," The lead by Casper Van Dien made me long for the high caliber acting of Steven Seagal in \On Deadly Ground\"""" as his line reading was so wooden that Woody Woodpecker was thinking of making a cameo to sit on his shoulder.","I had some time to kill before watching football so I saw this movie being offered on the scifi channel and it literally after watching it I thought I had encountered my version of mentally walking the Bataan death march as my conscious was beaten into submission by the awful movie which ripped off the Mummy series and Jurassic Park..  It was so bad that I thought the opening credits were the highlight of the movie and then it went into such a abysmal descent that it made the recent drop in the stock market seem like a hiccup..  The acting was so bad that I was hoping that one and all would be buried at the end..  I also noticed that his emotional range is so limited that I was under the impression my kitten was more expressive when asking for popcorn to eat ..  The direction was so abysmal I looked back yearning to my nephew's grade 3 play recital which had more pace and better vision and the fact that this movie seems to be have spliced together from afterthoughts of the aforementioned movie franchise it can not even be thought of as a homage..  The FX of the movie was so bad that I thought the director and producers were enviormentally friendly by recycling cheap special effects from grade Z horror flicks from yesteryear..  What Robert Wagner, Tom Bosley and Geoffrey Lewis were doing in this movies is beyond me and they should look at litigation against their agents for misrepresentation for getting them involved with such a dreck of a movie..  My warning to one and all is watch this movie at your peril as this movie may cause your IQ to diminish with prolonged viewing..  On a side note I noticed at IMDb that sometimes salaries for movies are published I was wondering if their is a way that actors that should give the salaries back for their poor performances in such movies..

8, I also noticed that his emotional range is so limited that I was under the impression my kitten was more expressive when asking for popcorn to eat .,"I had some time to kill before watching football so I saw this movie being offered on the scifi channel and it literally after watching it I thought I had encountered my version of mentally walking the Bataan death march as my conscious was beaten into submission by the awful movie which ripped off the Mummy series and Jurassic Park..  It was so bad that I thought the opening credits were the highlight of the movie and then it went into such a abysmal descent that it made the recent drop in the stock market seem like a hiccup..  The acting was so bad that I was hoping that one and all would be buried at the end..  The lead by Casper Van Dien made me long for the high caliber acting of Steven Seagal in \On Deadly Ground\"""" as his line reading was so wooden that Woody Woodpecker was thinking of making a cameo to sit on his shoulder..  The direction was so abysmal I looked back yearning to my nephew's grade 3 play recital which had more pace and better vision and the fact that this movie seems to be have spliced together from afterthoughts of the aforementioned movie franchise it can not even be thought of as a homage..  The FX of the movie was so bad that I thought the director and producers were enviormentally friendly by recycling cheap special effects from grade Z horror flicks from yesteryear..  What Robert Wagner, Tom Bosley and Geoffrey Lewis were doing in this movies is beyond me and they should look at litigation against their agents for misrepresentation for getting them involved with such a dreck of a movie..  My warning to one and all is watch this movie at your peril as this movie may cause your IQ to diminish with prolonged viewing..  On a side note I noticed at IMDb that sometimes salaries for movies are published I was wondering if their is a way that actors that should give the salaries back for their poor performances in such movies..

8, The direction was so abysmal I looked back yearning to my nephew's grade 3 play recital which had more pace and better vision and the fact that this movie seems to be have spliced together from afterthoughts of the aforementioned movie franchise it can not even be thought of as a homage.,"I had some time to kill before watching football so I saw this movie being offered on the scifi channel and it literally after watching it I thought I had encountered my version of mentally walking the Bataan death march as my conscious was beaten into submission by the awful movie which ripped off the Mummy series and Jurassic Park..  It was so bad that I thought the opening credits were the highlight of the movie and then it went into such a abysmal descent that it made the recent drop in the stock market seem like a hiccup..  The acting was so bad that I was hoping that one and all would be buried at the end..  The lead by Casper Van Dien made me long for the high caliber acting of Steven Seagal in \On Deadly Ground\"""" as his line reading was so wooden that Woody Woodpecker was thinking of making a cameo to sit on his shoulder..  I also noticed that his emotional range is so limited that I was under the impression my kitten was more expressive when asking for popcorn to eat ..  The FX of the movie was so bad that I thought the director and producers were enviormentally friendly by recycling cheap special effects from grade Z horror flicks from yesteryear..  What Robert Wagner, Tom Bosley and Geoffrey Lewis were doing in this movies is beyond me and they should look at litigation against their agents for misrepresentation for getting them involved with such a dreck of a movie..  My warning to one and all is watch this movie at your peril as this movie may cause your IQ to diminish with prolonged viewing..  On a side note I noticed at IMDb that sometimes salaries for movies are published I was wondering if their is a way that actors that should give the salaries back for their poor performances in such movies..

8, The FX of the movie was so bad that I thought the director and producers were enviormentally friendly by recycling cheap special effects from grade Z horror flicks from yesteryear.,"I had some time to kill before watching football so I saw this movie being offered on the scifi channel and it literally after watching it I thought I had encountered my version of mentally walking the Bataan death march as my conscious was beaten into submission by the awful movie which ripped off the Mummy series and Jurassic Park..  It was so bad that I thought the opening credits were the highlight of the movie and then it went into such a abysmal descent that it made the recent drop in the stock market seem like a hiccup..  The acting was so bad that I was hoping that one and all would be buried at the end..  The lead by Casper Van Dien made me long for the high caliber acting of Steven Seagal in \On Deadly Ground\"""" as his line reading was so wooden that Woody Woodpecker was thinking of making a cameo to sit on his shoulder..  I also noticed that his emotional range is so limited that I was under the impression my kitten was more expressive when asking for popcorn to eat ..  The direction was so abysmal I looked back yearning to my nephew's grade 3 play recital which had more pace and better vision and the fact that this movie seems to be have spliced together from afterthoughts of the aforementioned movie franchise it can not even be thought of as a homage..  What Robert Wagner, Tom Bosley and Geoffrey Lewis were doing in this movies is beyond me and they should look at litigation against their agents for misrepresentation for getting them involved with such a dreck of a movie..  My warning to one and all is watch this movie at your peril as this movie may cause your IQ to diminish with prolonged viewing..  On a side note I noticed at IMDb that sometimes salaries for movies are published I was wondering if their is a way that actors that should give the salaries back for their poor performances in such movies..

8," What Robert Wagner, Tom Bosley and Geoffrey Lewis were doing in this movies is beyond me and they should look at litigation against their agents for misrepresentation for getting them involved with such a dreck of a movie.","I had some time to kill before watching football so I saw this movie being offered on the scifi channel and it literally after watching it I thought I had encountered my version of mentally walking the Bataan death march as my conscious was beaten into submission by the awful movie which ripped off the Mummy series and Jurassic Park..  It was so bad that I thought the opening credits were the highlight of the movie and then it went into such a abysmal descent that it made the recent drop in the stock market seem like a hiccup..  The acting was so bad that I was hoping that one and all would be buried at the end..  The lead by Casper Van Dien made me long for the high caliber acting of Steven Seagal in \On Deadly Ground\"""" as his line reading was so wooden that Woody Woodpecker was thinking of making a cameo to sit on his shoulder..  I also noticed that his emotional range is so limited that I was under the impression my kitten was more expressive when asking for popcorn to eat ..  The direction was so abysmal I looked back yearning to my nephew's grade 3 play recital which had more pace and better vision and the fact that this movie seems to be have spliced together from afterthoughts of the aforementioned movie franchise it can not even be thought of as a homage..  The FX of the movie was so bad that I thought the director and producers were enviormentally friendly by recycling cheap special effects from grade Z horror flicks from yesteryear..  My warning to one and all is watch this movie at your peril as this movie may cause your IQ to diminish with prolonged viewing..  On a side note I noticed at IMDb that sometimes salaries for movies are published I was wondering if their is a way that actors that should give the salaries back for their poor performances in such movies..

8, My warning to one and all is watch this movie at your peril as this movie may cause your IQ to diminish with prolonged viewing.,"I had some time to kill before watching football so I saw this movie being offered on the scifi channel and it literally after watching it I thought I had encountered my version of mentally walking the Bataan death march as my conscious was beaten into submission by the awful movie which ripped off the Mummy series and Jurassic Park..  It was so bad that I thought the opening credits were the highlight of the movie and then it went into such a abysmal descent that it made the recent drop in the stock market seem like a hiccup..  The acting was so bad that I was hoping that one and all would be buried at the end..  The lead by Casper Van Dien made me long for the high caliber acting of Steven Seagal in \On Deadly Ground\"""" as his line reading was so wooden that Woody Woodpecker was thinking of making a cameo to sit on his shoulder..  I also noticed that his emotional range is so limited that I was under the impression my kitten was more expressive when asking for popcorn to eat ..  The direction was so abysmal I looked back yearning to my nephew's grade 3 play recital which had more pace and better vision and the fact that this movie seems to be have spliced together from afterthoughts of the aforementioned movie franchise it can not even be thought of as a homage..  The FX of the movie was so bad that I thought the director and producers were enviormentally friendly by recycling cheap special effects from grade Z horror flicks from yesteryear..  What Robert Wagner, Tom Bosley and Geoffrey Lewis were doing in this movies is beyond me and they should look at litigation against their agents for misrepresentation for getting them involved with such a dreck of a movie..  On a side note I noticed at IMDb that sometimes salaries for movies are published I was wondering if their is a way that actors that should give the salaries back for their poor performances in such movies..

8, On a side note I noticed at IMDb that sometimes salaries for movies are published I was wondering if their is a way that actors that should give the salaries back for their poor performances in such movies.,"I had some time to kill before watching football so I saw this movie being offered on the scifi channel and it literally after watching it I thought I had encountered my version of mentally walking the Bataan death march as my conscious was beaten into submission by the awful movie which ripped off the Mummy series and Jurassic Park..  It was so bad that I thought the opening credits were the highlight of the movie and then it went into such a abysmal descent that it made the recent drop in the stock market seem like a hiccup..  The acting was so bad that I was hoping that one and all would be buried at the end..  The lead by Casper Van Dien made me long for the high caliber acting of Steven Seagal in \On Deadly Ground\"""" as his line reading was so wooden that Woody Woodpecker was thinking of making a cameo to sit on his shoulder..  I also noticed that his emotional range is so limited that I was under the impression my kitten was more expressive when asking for popcorn to eat ..  The direction was so abysmal I looked back yearning to my nephew's grade 3 play recital which had more pace and better vision and the fact that this movie seems to be have spliced together from afterthoughts of the aforementioned movie franchise it can not even be thought of as a homage..  The FX of the movie was so bad that I thought the director and producers were enviormentally friendly by recycling cheap special effects from grade Z horror flicks from yesteryear..  What Robert Wagner, Tom Bosley and Geoffrey Lewis were doing in this movies is beyond me and they should look at litigation against their agents for misrepresentation for getting them involved with such a dreck of a movie..  My warning to one and all is watch this movie at your peril as this movie may cause your IQ to diminish with prolonged viewing..  Beware and be safe avoid at all costs..

8, Beware and be safe avoid at all costs.,"I had some time to kill before watching football so I saw this movie being offered on the scifi channel and it literally after watching it I thought I had encountered my version of mentally walking the Bataan death march as my conscious was beaten into submission by the awful movie which ripped off the Mummy series and Jurassic Park..  It was so bad that I thought the opening credits were the highlight of the movie and then it went into such a abysmal descent that it made the recent drop in the stock market seem like a hiccup..  The acting was so bad that I was hoping that one and all would be buried at the end..  The lead by Casper Van Dien made me long for the high caliber acting of Steven Seagal in \On Deadly Ground\"""" as his line reading was so wooden that Woody Woodpecker was thinking of making a cameo to sit on his shoulder..  I also noticed that his emotional range is so limited that I was under the impression my kitten was more expressive when asking for popcorn to eat ..  The direction was so abysmal I looked back yearning to my nephew's grade 3 play recital which had more pace and better vision and the fact that this movie seems to be have spliced together from afterthoughts of the aforementioned movie franchise it can not even be thought of as a homage..  The FX of the movie was so bad that I thought the director and producers were enviormentally friendly by recycling cheap special effects from grade Z horror flicks from yesteryear..  What Robert Wagner, Tom Bosley and Geoffrey Lewis were doing in this movies is beyond me and they should look at litigation against their agents for misrepresentation for getting them involved with such a dreck of a movie..  My warning to one and all is watch this movie at your peril as this movie may cause your IQ to diminish with prolonged viewing..  On a side note I noticed at IMDb that sometimes salaries for movies are published I was wondering if their is a way that actors that should give the salaries back for their poor performances in such movies..

9,"when i first saw this movie i was literally rolling around on the floor laughing (especially when they were getting chased by the water, and when the guy drove through peoples gardens, i mean would it hurt to drive around the washing line?) the special effects! this movie clearly didn't have a big budget."," either that or the guy left his toddler in charge of the controls..  the water coming out of the damn looked like a close up of a can of beer that had fizzed up..  what were the actors thinking? did they actually believe that it was a good movie? or did they just really need the money? not that they would've earned a lot..  when i first saw this, i was like 'god, how old is this?' when i looked on the info about it and saw that it was made in 2003, i thought my TV was broken.. <br /><br />this really is a disaster movie, in more ways than one..

9, either that or the guy left his toddler in charge of the controls.,"when i first saw this movie i was literally rolling around on the floor laughing (especially when they were getting chased by the water, and when the guy drove through peoples gardens, i mean would it hurt to drive around the washing line?) the special effects! this movie clearly didn't have a big budget..  the water coming out of the damn looked like a close up of a can of beer that had fizzed up..  what were the actors thinking? did they actually believe that it was a good movie? or did they just really need the money? not that they would've earned a lot..  when i first saw this, i was like 'god, how old is this?' when i looked on the info about it and saw that it was made in 2003, i thought my TV was broken.. <br /><br />this really is a disaster movie, in more ways than one..

9, the water coming out of the damn looked like a close up of a can of beer that had fizzed up.,"when i first saw this movie i was literally rolling around on the floor laughing (especially when they were getting chased by the water, and when the guy drove through peoples gardens, i mean would it hurt to drive around the washing line?) the special effects! this movie clearly didn't have a big budget..  either that or the guy left his toddler in charge of the controls..  what were the actors thinking? did they actually believe that it was a good movie? or did they just really need the money? not that they would've earned a lot..  when i first saw this, i was like 'god, how old is this?' when i looked on the info about it and saw that it was made in 2003, i thought my TV was broken.. <br /><br />this really is a disaster movie, in more ways than one..

9, what were the actors thinking? did they actually believe that it was a good movie? or did they just really need the money? not that they would've earned a lot.,"when i first saw this movie i was literally rolling around on the floor laughing (especially when they were getting chased by the water, and when the guy drove through peoples gardens, i mean would it hurt to drive around the washing line?) the special effects! this movie clearly didn't have a big budget..  either that or the guy left his toddler in charge of the controls..  the water coming out of the damn looked like a close up of a can of beer that had fizzed up..  when i first saw this, i was like 'god, how old is this?' when i looked on the info about it and saw that it was made in 2003, i thought my TV was broken.. <br /><br />this really is a disaster movie, in more ways than one..

9," when i first saw this, i was like 'god, how old is this?' when i looked on the info about it and saw that it was made in 2003, i thought my TV was broken.","when i first saw this movie i was literally rolling around on the floor laughing (especially when they were getting chased by the water, and when the guy drove through peoples gardens, i mean would it hurt to drive around the washing line?) the special effects! this movie clearly didn't have a big budget..  either that or the guy left his toddler in charge of the controls..  the water coming out of the damn looked like a close up of a can of beer that had fizzed up..  what were the actors thinking? did they actually believe that it was a good movie? or did they just really need the money? not that they would've earned a lot.. <br /><br />this really is a disaster movie, in more ways than one..

9,"<br /><br />this really is a disaster movie, in more ways than one.","when i first saw this movie i was literally rolling around on the floor laughing (especially when they were getting chased by the water, and when the guy drove through peoples gardens, i mean would it hurt to drive around the washing line?) the special effects! this movie clearly didn't have a big budget..  either that or the guy left his toddler in charge of the controls..  the water coming out of the damn looked like a close up of a can of beer that had fizzed up..  what were the actors thinking? did they actually believe that it was a good movie? or did they just really need the money? not that they would've earned a lot..  when i first saw this, i was like 'god, how old is this?' when i looked on the info about it and saw that it was made in 2003, i thought my TV was broken..
